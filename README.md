# ChatQ 

ChatQ is a powerful framework designed to seamlessly convert natural language queries (NLQ) into structured query language (SQL) commands. Leveraging cutting-edge natural language processing (NLP) techniques, ChatQ accurately interprets user queries and generates corresponding SQL queries tailored to specific database schemas.

## Key Components

### 1. Schema Linking Module
This module utilizes the sentence embedding model [all-MiniLM-L6-v2](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2) from Hugging Face's Sentence Transformers library to interpret user queries and identify relevant columns and tables from the database schema. It plays a crucial role in understanding the context of the user's query within the database schema.

### 2. NSQL Model
The NSQL model, based on [Numbers Station Labs' NSText2SQL model](https://huggingface.co/NumbersStation/nsql-350M), generates SQL queries based on the identified schema elements and user queries. It utilizes sophisticated algorithms to map natural language constructs to SQL syntax accurately

### 3. Evaluation Framework
An experimental setup is established to evaluate the effectiveness of ChatQ. This framework includes comprehensive metrics such as recall, precision, and F1 score to assess the accuracy and performance of the system.

### 4. Domain-specific Adaptation
ChatQ can be adapted to specific domains by refining schema filtering mechanisms and leveraging domain-specific language models. This flexibility ensures that ChatQ can be tailored to various application scenarios with diverse database schemas.

## Experimental Workflow

1. **Schema Linking Evaluation:** Assessing the accuracy and performance of the schema linking module through metrics such as recall, precision, and F1 score.

4. **SQL Structure and Query Result Comparison:** Comparing the SQL structures and query results generated by ChatQ and baseline LLM models to identify strengths and weaknesses.

## Purpose

ChatQ aims to bridge the gap between human language understanding and SQL query modeling. By providing a robust and efficient solution for converting NLQs into SQL queries, ChatQ enhances the accuracy and usability of NLQ to SQL conversion, catering to diverse application scenarios.
