nowadays	probably	no	one	has	heard	of	artificial	intelligence	ai	technology	that	people	talk	about	and	believe	will	be	one	of	the	hottest	topics	of	the	feature	of	ai	is	the	ability	to	quickly	learn	and	analyze	large	amounts	of	data	and	analyze	and	process	the	data	to	manage	the	data
with	this	outstanding	feature	of	ai	various	business	sectors	are	brought	to	further	develop	their	work	systems	to	be	more	efficient
both	in	finance	management	and	marketing	medical	logistics	legal	etc
and	with	the	limitless	capabilities	of	ai	even	software	leaders	like	bill	gates	also	sees	that	ai	has	created	new	paradigm	paradigm	shift	that	will	replace	old	paradigms	like	the	internet	and	computers	in	the	near	future
from	the	current	situation	it	can	be	seen	that	global	giants	are	accelerating	the	development	of	such	technologies	to	intensely	compete	for	market	share	for	example	amazon	has	partnered	with	stability	ai	to	become	cloud	provider	currently	worth	over	billion	dollars
that	creates	an	ai	tool	that	processes	text	into	images	to	help	users	create	art	in	the	digital	world
and	in	november	microsoft	partnered	with	nvidia	to	invest	in	openai	launching	chatgpt	which	within	the	first	days	of	launching
with	more	than	million	active	users	microsoft	recently	launched	microsoft	teams	premium	that	integrates	chatgpt	to	increase	productivity
which	can	prepare	summary	of	the	meeting	summary	of	meeting	issues	with	transcribed	text	including	real	time	language	translation	as	well	chatgpt	is	one	of	the	gpt	generative	pretrained	transformer	or	advanced	language	model	programs	developed	by	openai	that	sees	the	opportunity	to	develop	such	language	models
due	to	the	ever	increasing	demand	for	ai	applications	in	industries	such	as	customer	service	commerce	or	the	entertainment	industry
thanks	to	the	capabilities	of	this	language	model	openai	has	been	able	to	attract	major	venture	capitalists	like	microsoft	who	invested	over	billion	in	openai	in	and	plans	to	invest	over	ten	billion	dollars	in	the	future	bringing	openai	value	to	billion
billion	dollars	ever
chatgpt	the	latest	innovation	from	openai	backed	by	microsoft	is	highly	specialized	use	of	ai	for	language	processing
chatgpt	has	unique	ability	to	respond	naturally	to	all	questions
it	can	also	create	conversations	translate	languages	process	language
write	quality	articles	draft	speeches	monologues	ceremonies	or	even	composing	songs	and	creating	new	scientific	theories
chatgpt	multi	lingual	capabilities	are	an	important	help	for	businesses
especially	the	marketing	business	lines	that	can	use	chatgpt	to	interact	with	customers	create	content	or	articles
helping	stores	create	more	customer	interactions	and	ai	can	learn	to	analyze	statistical	data	to	predict	future	trends	and	probabilities
chatgpt	limitations	and	moral	issues	although	chatgpt	is	currently	beneficial	to	various	circles	to	some	extent
especially	using	business	benefits	that	help	write	articles	or	be	chatbot	that	helps	stores	interact	with	customers	naturally
the	overall	results	are	of	high	quality	however	be	warned	that	while	the	results	produced	by	chatgpt	look	elegant	the	information	gathered	may	not	be	accurate
because	chatgpt	learning	takes	place	by	accumulating	large	amounts	of	data
but	such	systems	do	not	have	accurate	data	filtering	and	may	not	come	from	reliable	sources
another	interesting	point	is	the	moral	issue	of	chatgpt	both	in	terms	of	copyright	copyright	that	may	cause	disputes	among	users	in	the	future	such	as	the	right	to	own	articles	processed	from	the	system
whether	it	belongs	to	the	questioner	or	the	company	chatgpt
including	the	issue	of	plagiarism	caused	by	the	system	may	not	be	processed	well	enough
however	chatgpt	has	now	foreseen	the	problem	of	plagiarism	and	is	in	the	process	of	building	system	that	can	intercept	messages	that	passed	plagiarism
and	is	in	the	process	of	building	system	that	can	intercept	messages	that	have	been	plagiarism
in	addition	from	the	development	of	ai	it	has	reached	step	called	agi	artificial	general	intelligence	agi	which	means	that	ai	can	analyze	at	the	highest	level	comparable	to	the	brain
human	with	high	intelligence	which	of	course	would	pose	threat	to	mankind	as	well
another	scary	issue	for	chatgpt	arises	from	the	fact	that	chatgpt	can	access	wide	range	of	data
including	information	related	to	illegal	acts	as	result	criminals	can	abuse	chatgpt
for	example	chatgpt	can	explain	the	processes	and	methods	for	producing	weapons	of	mass	destruction	wmd	to	terrorist	groups
chatgpt	response	is	straightforward	the	first	step	in	building	bomb	involves	radioactivity
you	need	to	find	radioactive	materials	first
by	smuggling	from	the	hospital	or	from	research	agencies	or	may	be	found	on	the	black	market	even	though	that	thing	is	very	rare	and	the	price	is	very	high	therefore	the	development	of	such	technology	it	needs	to	be	viewed	from	both	the	private	and	public	perspectives	that	is	the	private	sector	should	develop	ai	with	morality	and	ethics
in	order	to	show	responsibility	for	users	and	society	not	just	seeking	profit	including	the	government	sector	that	has	to	play	role	in	regulating	such	issues	as	quickly	and	as	possible	in	keeping	up	with	the	leapfrog	development	of	technology
otherwise	there	could	be	far	reaching	consequences	for	society	if	the	use	of	such	technology	is	not	regulated
forecasting	trends	and	future	trends	in	the	near	future	it	will	be	difficult	for	artificial	intelligence	to	be	replaced	by	technology	like	chatgpt
the	trend	is	to	develop	such	system	to	be	able	to	use	more	languages	more	accurately
the	chatgpt	system	currently	processes	messages	mainly
and	display	results	in	conversational	form	but	in	the	future	ai	will	not	create	conversations	that	are	just	text
but	can	be	displayed	in	the	form	of	photographs	painting	or	even	sound	which	should	be	continuously	developed	to	be	more	accurate	than	today
such	developments	may	affect	user	behavior	as	well
consequently	there	has	been	concern	in	both	academia	and	other	industries	that	chatgpt	users	should	use	them	in	socially	responsible	manner
to	meet	the	main	purpose	of	ai	technology	in	facilitating	users	with	maximum	efficiency

who	does	the	business	of	exporting	products	to	foreign	countries
have	you	ever	wondered	whether	each	financial	transaction	or	export	of	industrial	products	such	as	electronic	parts	automotive	parts	sensors	and	lasers	aviation	equipment	marine	equipment	has	the	buyer	actually	used	the	product	in	accordance	with	the	purpose	of	the	product	or	not
an	exporter	may	have	encountered	new	customer	who	requested	large	amount	of	such	goods	but	asked	to	pay	in	cash
or	may	purchase	goods	by	having	them	shipped	to	an	unfamiliar	destination	country	including	changing	the	route	of	transporting	goods	by	change	company	address	frequently	these	are	indicators
indicators	red	flags	that	the	exporter	suspects	may	be	at	risk	of	being	involved	in	the	business	of	terrorist	groups
the	company	we	are	doing	business	with	may	be	front	company
this	is	associated	with	the	proliferation	of	weapons	of	mass	destruction	wmd	where	terrorist	groups	are	willing	to	pay	large	sums	for	dual	use	items	dui
to	be	produced	or	modified	into	weapons
these	are	the	reasons	why	thai	entrepreneurs	should	pay	close	attention	to	routine	inspections	of	industrial	goods	traded	for	dui	including	customer	and	end	use	inspections
to	prevent	their	companies	from	being	involved	in	terrorism	or	money	laundering	in	the	future
what	are	dual	use	items	dui
dual	use	items	dui	are	items	that	can	be	used	for	both	commercial	and	military	applications
which	when	the	entrepreneur	sells	such	products	the	destination	can	use	the	goods	for	general	trade
but	it	could	be	related	to	chemical	biological	or	nuclear	weapons
dui	infiltrates	many	industries	including	the	automotive	industry
electronics	aviation	marine	equipment	sensors	and	lasers	examples	of	dui	products	such	as	ball	bearings	are	often	components	of	machinery	in	heavy	industrial	plants
in	the	hands	of	terrorists	it	could	be	used	as	component	of	nuclear	weapons
carbon	fibers	typically	used	in	sports	equipment	such	as	tennis	rackets	can	be	component	of	carbon	dioxide	generator
corona	virus	coronavirus	is	also	dual	use	product
because	it	can	be	vaccine	or	can	be	made	into	biological	weapon
two	way	product	how	is	it	important	to	entrepreneurs	in	running	business
although	at	present	the	government	has	not	yet	imposed	measures	to	obtain	approval	for	the	export	of	goods	and	technologies	related	to	dui	but	entrepreneurs	in	every	industry	should	know	whether	the	goods	produced	or	exported	are	dui	or	not	because	such	goods	are	regarded	as	it	is	random	product	that	is	associated	with	terrorism
and	if	the	company	does	not	audit	end	customers	regarding	use	and	end	users	end	use	and	end	user	screening
penalties	may	be	imposed	under	the	controlling	goods	related	to	the	proliferation	of	weapons	of	mass	destruction	act	of	in	addition	in	terrorist	groups	such	as	the	taliban	al	qaeda	and	al	qaeda
are	also	often	linked	to	money	laundering	in	acquiring	weapons	related	to	weapons	of	mass	destruction	wmd
therefore	companies	that	do	not	have	an	internal	compliance	program	icp	to	verify	customers	before	making	commercial	transactions
including	financial	transactions	they	may	also	be	subject	to	penalties	for	money	laundering	under	the	anti	terrorism	and	proliferation	of	weapons	of	mass	destruction	financing	act
how	can	companies	prevent	involvement	in	terrorism	and	the	spread	of	weapons	of	mass	destruction	wmd
companies	should	focus	on	having	internal	compliance	program	icp	which	is	an	international	system	to	prevent	companies	from	getting	involved	in	the	spread	of	wmd
the	main	prevention	methods	are	as	follows	check	if	the	company	has	exported	dui	or	not
entrepreneurs	can	preliminarily	check	whether	the	goods	they	have	are	dui	or	not	through	the	website	of	the	department	of	foreign	trade
ministry	of	commerce	which	can	be	entered	as	search	term	customs	tariff	hs	code	or	chemical	number	cas	number	at	the	website
end	use	and	end	user	screening	before	trading	with	new	international	clients	the	company	should	verify	that	the	customer	list	is	in	the	database	of	individuals	or	groups	involved	in	the	spread	of	wmd	which	can	be	verified	on	the	united	nations	security	council	consolidated	list
at	the	website	check	whether	the	customer	is	in	the	database	related	to	money	laundering	or	not
amlo	has	published	list	of	people	who	are	designated	under	the	prevention	and	suppression	of	financing	of	terrorism	and	proliferation	of	weapons	of	mass	destruction	act
so	before	trading	with	customers	the	company	should	also	check	the	list	of	customers	in	the	database	of	persons	involved	in	money	laundering	under	the	act
you	can	search	the	information	of	the	designated	person	at	for	exporters	scb	offers	the	scb	trade	club	platform	system	that	helps	centralize	data	to	make	it	easier	for	entrepreneurs	to	manage	external	data
is	complete	information	center	on	international	trade	in	one	place	who	can	search	for	partners	in	each	country	and	in	the	desired	industry	category
including	studying	statistical	data	on	documents	rules	and	regulations	so	both	business	partners	can	know	each	other	basic	background	whether	they	match	or	not	it	saves	time	and	negotiates	easily

skin	is	like	garment	of	the	body
especially	the	facial	skin	it	is	more	important	as	it	reflects	the	beauty	and	youth
therefore	facial	treatment	is	another	routine	that	both	men	and	women	pay	attention	to
many	people	invest	in	thousands	of	thousands	of	expensive	skincare	products	to	maintain	the	youthfulness	of	their	faces
but	do	you	know	that	actually	the	natural	essential	oil	is	another	great	option	for	moisturizing	protection
it	creates	radiance	to	the	skin	as	well
it	also	safe	from	chemicals	because	it	extracted	from	natural	ingredients
importantly	it	cheaper	than	many	well	known	brands	of	skin	care	creams	but	many	people	are	afraid	and	think	that	using	oil	to	nourish	their	skin	will	make	their	skin	too	oily	or	cause	acne
and	not	at	all	using	the	right	oil	for	your	skin	type	will	help	reduce	oiliness	and	reduce	the	clogging	of	pores	that	can	cause	acne	breakouts
today	we	have	oil	or	facial	oil	that	is	suitable	for	each	skin	type	to	leave	each	other
oily	skin	jojoba	oil	is	lightweight	oil
it	has	the	ability	to	reduce	excess	oil	on	the	face	while	moisturizing	create	balance	for	the	skin	at	the	same	time
grape	seed	oil	is	great	oil	for	oily	skin
because	there	are	substances	that	reduce	oil	production	of	the	skin
thus	reducing	the	oiliness	of	the	skin	very	well	and	just	the	skin	to	return	to	balance	without	fear	of	oily	skin
it	is	lighter	than	jojoba	oil
dry	skin	almond	oil	is	highly	hydrating	but	gentle	oil	for	dry	sensitive	skin	suitable	for	dry	to	very	dry	skin
it	is	also	high	in	vitamin	vitamin	is	precursor	to	retinol	which	can	reduce	fine	lines	and	wrinkles
marula	oil	is	an	oil	that	is	quickly	absorbed	into	the	skin	by	gently	massaging	the	skin
due	to	its	intense	moisture	it	protects	the	skin	from	dehydration	and	maintains	the	skin	moisture	throughout	the	day
acne	prone	skin	pomegranate	seed	oil	has	natural	antibacterial	effect
thereby	reducing	bacteria	in	the	pores	and	preventing	inflammation	of	acne	and	facial	skin
it	is	also	light	oil	that	does	not	cause	clogging
rosehip	oil	is	very	suitable	for	skin	with	inflamed	acne	red	rashes
rosehip	oil	moisturizes	the	skin	at	deep	level	but	does	not	clog	pores	helping	to	reduce	acne	dark	spots	redness	from	acne
theres	test	of	using	rosehip	oil	for	weeks	in	row	and	found	that	it	really	helped	to	reduce	acne	on	his	face
normal	skin	argan	oil	many	people	call	argan	oil	versatile	oil
moisturizing	the	skin
prevents	oil	from	evaporating	from	the	skin
and	absorbed	into	the	skin	quickly	contains	high	amounts	of	vitamin	contains	free	radicals	that	protects	the	skin	from	being	damaged	by	pollution	both	dark	spots	and	small	wrinkles	make	the	skin	soft	and	gentle
retinol	oils	help	smooth	bright	and	reduce	the	appearance	of	fine	lines	and	wrinkles
moisturizing	the	skin
but	not	irritating	it	is	recommended	to	use	at	night	after	applying	moisturizer
sensitive	skin	moringa	oil	moringa	oil	is	an	oil	rich	in	antioxidants	helps	protect	skin	from	side	effects
it	has	the	right	amount	of	oil	to	help	retain	moisture	on	the	skin	as	well	reduce	irritation
it	lightweight	but	hydrating	oil	that	just	right	for	the	skin	can	be	used	before	makeup	without	making	the	face	oily
aloe	vera	oil	is	rich	in	antioxidants	and	substances	that	reduce	irritation	including	substances	that	help	reduce	acne	causing	bacteria
therefore	this	oil	is	suitable	for	sensitive	and	acne	prone	skin
you	can	see	that	we	can	create	beautiful	skin	with	natural	extracts	but	different	oils
these	are	not	ghost	pills	that	will	immediately	solve	the	problem
especially	if	anyone	has	serious	skin	problems	such	as	sagging	deep	floating	streaks
if	you	want	to	be	beautiful	quickly	you	need	to	use	various	beauty	technologies	from	beauty	clinic	as	helper

when	talking	about	generations	many	of	you	have	probably	heard	the	story	and	are	very	familiar	with	gen	what	is	the	next	generation	after	gen
the	youngest	and	newest	generation	in	the	world	is	alpha	generation	or	simply	called	alpha	gen	itself
alpha	gen	is	child	born	between	and	or	when	compared	to	gen	who	had	just	graduated	and	entered	the	early	working	age	the	oldest	generation	of	gen	alpha	is	still	in	its	infancy	as	of
gen	alpha	is	the	offspring	of	gen	who	are	often	older	parents	having	little	ones	therefore	those	children	are	wealthy	without	having	to	struggle	as	much	as	other	models
they	experience	digital	devices	and	technology	since	birth
they	study	lot	study	for	long	time	and	have	variety	live	in	capitalist	society
therefore	they	tend	to	be	materialistic	people	accustomed	to	change	easily	bored	has	low	patience
this	young	generation	only	knows	society	with	technology
born	in	an	era	of	competition	until	some	offices	call	this	child	alpha	generation	the	ipad	generation
they	learn	and	use	technology	almost	from	birth	and	grew	up	with	the	skills	to	use	technology	effectively
this	generation	has	an	average	internet	usage	rate	of	per	day	and	has	tendency	to	increase	steadily	which	encourages	children	of	this	age	to	be	group	of	people	who	will	have	great	potential	in	the	future	it	genius	who	can	use	technology	smarter
they	accept	and	understand	the	difference
because	he	grew	up	in	world	without	borders	including	being	generation	that	started	to	have	the	same	culture	as	together	all	over	the	world
in	addition	they	are	also	able	to	adapt	to	various	changes	well	because	they	were	born	in	an	era	where	the	world	changes	very	quickly
society	must	be	prepared	and	use	the	potential	of	this	new	generation	to	understand	their	nature
alpha	gen	children	use	technology	to	work	best	and	are	much	more	agile	than	other	generations
because	they	were	born	in	the	age	of	perfect	digital
moreover	this	generation	will	have	low	concentration	on	things	that	they	are	not	interested	in
but	they	will	concentrate	highly	on	technology	as	well	as	having	good	data	acquisition	and	data	analysis	skills
and	this	generation	will	be	able	to	create	new	innovations	better	than	other	gens	in	the	past	because	he	was	born	in	an	era	where	innovation	is	easy	for	everyone	all	genders	and	ages	types	of	careers	that	alpha	gen	people	are	interested	in	are	as	follow	content	creation	including	writing	making	videos	for	various	channels	which	can	generate	lot	of	income
but	it	depends	on	their	skills	and	creativity	such	as	being	youtuber	blogger	vlogger	etc
this	is	space	where	they	can	express	themselves	in	unique	way
it	is	platform	to	release	energy	and	creativity	as	well	as	their	opinions	on	the	world	and	society
they	can	also	make	money	from	their	own	preferences
gamers	sport	and	game	casters	games	will	be	career	that	grows	and	can	earn	lot	of	money
from	being	gamer	or	caster	game	to	gamer	like	sport
startups	this	young	generation	has	desire	to	be	successful	at	an	early	age
they	love	independent	life	as	their	own	boss	rather	than	an	employee
having	business	of	their	own	can	fully	meet	their	needs

this	line	of	work	is	therefore	more	in	demand	in	the	future	and	can	generate	huge	income
social	creator	this	generation	will	live	according	to	their	own	preferences	and	needs
because	they	have	both	full	knowledge	and	ability
at	the	same	time	there	is	interest	in	wanting	to	be	part	of	creating	better	world
therefore	there	is	tendency	for	this	generation	to	turn	to	work	to	solve	social	problems	environment	and	volunteer	work	to	help	people	such	as	social	innovation	developers	to	drive	change	both	nationally	and	globally	parenting	in	the	digital	age	or	the	generation	of	alpha	generation	children	the	way	of	parenting	and	the	role	of	parents	must	change	to	keep	up	with	the	changes

it	can	be	seen	that	online	financial	transactions	have	many	advantages	especially	in	terms	of	comfort	but	users	have	to	be	especially	careful
because	the	convenience	may	cause	us	to	fail	to	think	and	become	victim	of	scammers	without	knowing
more	importantly	scammers	still	have	many	scams	that	are	ready	to	lure	victims	to	death

many	people	may	have	questions
individuals	who	have	income	are	already	filing	taxes	every	year	why	do	they	have	to	pay	half	year	tax	again
only	those	with	certain	incomes	are	eligible	for	the	half	year	tax
that	is	paying	taxes	for	half	this	year	is	relief	from	the	tax	burden
because	if	there	is	no	filing	of	the
or	half	year	personal	income	tax	return	individuals	must	file	personal	income	tax	returns	and	pay	large	amounts	of	tax
however	the	amount	paid	can	be	used	to	deduct	from	the	calculated	annual	tax
for	example	mr	has	filed	return	and	paid	half	year	personal	income	tax	of	baht
at	the	end	of	the	year	he	calculates	the	tax	that	must	be	paid	in	the	amount	of	baht
so	he	will	pay	an	additional	tax	of	only	baht	baht

in	addition	to	filing	annual	personal	taxes	there	is	another	group	of	income	that	must	be	taxed	in	the	middle	of	the	year	through	filing
form	or	return	for	personal	income	tax	filing
for	non	salary	income	from	january	to	june	the	tax	must	be	filed	between	july	and	september
and	when	filing	this
form	at	the	end	of	the	year	income	tax	must	be	calculated	from	january	to	december	and	filed
again	by	bringing	the	amount	of	tax	that	has	been	paid	in	accordance	with	the
to	subtract
who	is	required	to	submit	por	ngor	dor	form
those	who	must	submit
form	are	individuals	having	income	according	to	the	tax	law	section	which	are	category	money	or	benefits	derived	from	renting	properties	such	as	land	houses	cars	etc
category	income	from	independent	professions	such	as	law	practice	of	the	art	of	healing	engineering	architecture	accounting	fine	arts	or	other	independent	professions	category	income	from	contracts	that	provide	essential	baggage	other	than	equipment
category	income	income	from	business	commerce	agriculture	industry	transportation	or	other	things	other	than	those	specified	in	income	categories	can	not	file	personal	income	tax	for	half	year
failure	to	file	taxes	will	be	punished	by	law	which	is	fine	of	baht	and	an	additional	fee	interest	from	the	tax	that	must	be	paid	at	rate	of	per	month	fraction	of	month	is	equal	to	month	starting	from	the	th	september	onwards
in	summary	what	everyone	needs	to	know	as	an	individual	is	to	file	half	year	personal	income	tax	within	the	period	specified	by	law
because	filing	semi	annual	taxes	is	not	burden
but	it	is	duty	and	something	that	everyone	should	know	and	understand	in	order	to	file	and	pay	taxes	correctly
if	we	use	appropriately	credit	card	instead	of	cash	we	will	gain	various	benefits
installment	promotion	or	various	discount	benefits	attached	to	that	credit	card	or	interest	free	period	for	paying	on	time
but	for	those	who	use	credit	cards	and	like	to	pay	at	least	let	see	how	does	frequent	minimum	credit	card	payments	affect	us
the	interest	calculation	starts	from	the	date	of	spending
if	we	choose	to	pay	minimum	on	credit	card	interest	amounts	will	be	charged
the	first	amount	will	be	charged	from	the	spending	balance	from	the	first	day	until	the	due	date	and	the	second	amount	is	the	interest	on	the	balance	after	the	minimum	payment	from	the	date	we	pay	the	minimum	until	the	closing	date	of	next	month
if	we	regularly	pay	the	minimum	of	course	interest	rates	must	continue	to	rise	undeniably
interest	is	charged	from	the	date	the	minimum	payment	is	made	but	actually	interest	starts	on	the	day	we	spend	it
no	interest	free	period
usually	credit	card	providers	offer	interest	free	periods	to	their	card	holders	from	the	first	day	of	spending	until	the	payment	due	date
if	we	plan	to	prepare	money	for	full	amount	payment	we	will	benefit	from	this	period
it	is	credit	usage	instead	of	cash	which	helps	to	increase	liquidity	without	paying	interest
but	if	we	choose	to	pay	the	minimum	credit	card	the	right	to	use	the	interest	free	period	will	expire	immediately
and	we	have	to	pay	interest	from	the	first	day	of	spending	which	will	cause	the	interest	in	that	accounting	period	to	increase
longer	installments	higher	interest	rate
once	we	choose	paying	the	minimum	credit	card	of	course	we	will	have	longer	debt	because	the	principal	that	was	spent	firstly	cannot	be	cleared	completely	as	scheduled	which	resulted	in	an	increase	in	interest
and	if	we	continue	to	use	credit	cards	with	the	minimum	pay	on	credit	card	every	month	the	amount	of	debt	and	interest	will	increase	until	it	becomes	large	debt
it	causes	longer	debt	to	pay	off	and	the	chances	of	getting	out	of	the	debt	cycle	will	be	even	more	difficult
signs	of	over	indebtedness
the	minimum	monthly	credit	card	payment	is	one	of	the	warning	signs	that	we	are	not	able	to	manage	expenses	as	planned
that	points	out	that	we	have	more	expenses	than	we	earn	so	we	should	stop	using	credit	cards	first	to	clear	up	less	debt
but	if	we	continue	to	use	the	card	and	pay	the	minimum	the	interest	will	increase	which	incur	an	excess	debt
finally	even	the	minimum	payment	becomes	more	difficult	spoil	the	credit	and	may	have	to	pay	more	interest	and	various	fines	affecting	daily	life
after	spending	via	credit	card	every	month	it	is	important	that	we	plan	to	pay	back	the	full	amount	when	the	payment	is	due	in	order	to	get	the	most	benefits	of	the	credit	card	usage	and	does	not	create	any	future	spending	problems
for	anyone	who	wants	to	know	how	to	spend	with	their	own	credit	card	each	month
you	can	access	the	just	for	you	function	in	the	scb	easy	app	to	check	your	monthly	spending
it	is	classified	by	credit	card	category

nowadays	probably	no	one	has	heard	of	artificial	intelligence	ai	technology	that	people	talk	about	and	believe	will	be	one	of	the	hottest	topics	of	the	feature	of	ai	is	the	ability	to	quickly	learn	and	analyze	large	amounts	of	data	and	analyze	and	process	the	data	to	manage	the	data
with	this	outstanding	feature	of	ai	various	business	sectors	are	brought	to	further	develop	their	work	systems	to	be	more	efficient
both	in	finance	management	and	marketing	medical	logistics	legal	etc
and	with	the	limitless	capabilities	of	ai	even	software	leaders	like	bill	gates	also	sees	that	ai	has	created	new	paradigm	paradigm	shift	that	will	replace	old	paradigms	like	the	internet	and	computers	in	the	near	future
from	the	current	situation	it	can	be	seen	that	global	giants	are	accelerating	the	development	of	such	technologies	to	intensely	compete	for	market	share	for	example	amazon	has	partnered	with	stability	ai	to	become	cloud	provider	currently	worth	over	billion	dollars
that	creates	an	ai	tool	that	processes	text	into	images	to	help	users	create	art	in	the	digital	world
and	in	november	microsoft	partnered	with	nvidia	to	invest	in	openai	launching	chatgpt	which	within	the	first	days	of	launching
with	more	than	million	active	users	microsoft	recently	launched	microsoft	teams	premium	that	integrates	chatgpt	to	increase	productivity
which	can	prepare	summary	of	the	meeting	summary	of	meeting	issues	with	transcribed	text	including	real	time	language	translation	as	well	chatgpt	is	one	of	the	gpt	generative	pretrained	transformer	or	advanced	language	model	programs	developed	by	openai	that	sees	the	opportunity	to	develop	such	language	models
due	to	the	ever	increasing	demand	for	ai	applications	in	industries	such	as	customer	service	commerce	or	the	entertainment	industry
thanks	to	the	capabilities	of	this	language	model	openai	has	been	able	to	attract	major	venture	capitalists	like	microsoft	who	invested	over	billion	in	openai	in	and	plans	to	invest	over	ten	billion	dollars	in	the	future	bringing	openai	value	to	billion
billion	dollars	ever
chatgpt	the	latest	innovation	from	openai	backed	by	microsoft	is	highly	specialized	use	of	ai	for	language	processing
chatgpt	has	unique	ability	to	respond	naturally	to	all	questions
it	can	also	create	conversations	translate	languages	process	language
write	quality	articles	draft	speeches	monologues	ceremonies	or	even	composing	songs	and	creating	new	scientific	theories
chatgpt	multi	lingual	capabilities	are	an	important	help	for	businesses
especially	the	marketing	business	lines	that	can	use	chatgpt	to	interact	with	customers	create	content	or	articles
helping	stores	create	more	customer	interactions	and	ai	can	learn	to	analyze	statistical	data	to	predict	future	trends	and	probabilities
chatgpt	limitations	and	moral	issues	although	chatgpt	is	currently	beneficial	to	various	circles	to	some	extent
especially	using	business	benefits	that	help	write	articles	or	be	chatbot	that	helps	stores	interact	with	customers	naturally
the	overall	results	are	of	high	quality	however	be	warned	that	while	the	results	produced	by	chatgpt	look	elegant	the	information	gathered	may	not	be	accurate
because	chatgpt	learning	takes	place	by	accumulating	large	amounts	of	data
but	such	systems	do	not	have	accurate	data	filtering	and	may	not	come	from	reliable	sources
another	interesting	point	is	the	moral	issue	of	chatgpt	both	in	terms	of	copyright	copyright	that	may	cause	disputes	among	users	in	the	future	such	as	the	right	to	own	articles	processed	from	the	system
whether	it	belongs	to	the	questioner	or	the	company	chatgpt
including	the	issue	of	plagiarism	caused	by	the	system	may	not	be	processed	well	enough
however	chatgpt	has	now	foreseen	the	problem	of	plagiarism	and	is	in	the	process	of	building	system	that	can	intercept	messages	that	passed	plagiarism
and	is	in	the	process	of	building	system	that	can	intercept	messages	that	have	been	plagiarism
in	addition	from	the	development	of	ai	it	has	reached	step	called	agi	artificial	general	intelligence	agi	which	means	that	ai	can	analyze	at	the	highest	level	comparable	to	the	brain
human	with	high	intelligence	which	of	course	would	pose	threat	to	mankind	as	well
another	scary	issue	for	chatgpt	arises	from	the	fact	that	chatgpt	can	access	wide	range	of	data
including	information	related	to	illegal	acts	as	result	criminals	can	abuse	chatgpt
for	example	chatgpt	can	explain	the	processes	and	methods	for	producing	weapons	of	mass	destruction	wmd	to	terrorist	groups
chatgpt	response	is	straightforward	the	first	step	in	building	bomb	involves	radioactivity
you	need	to	find	radioactive	materials	first
by	smuggling	from	the	hospital	or	from	research	agencies	or	may	be	found	on	the	black	market	even	though	that	thing	is	very	rare	and	the	price	is	very	high	therefore	the	development	of	such	technology	it	needs	to	be	viewed	from	both	the	private	and	public	perspectives	that	is	the	private	sector	should	develop	ai	with	morality	and	ethics
in	order	to	show	responsibility	for	users	and	society	not	just	seeking	profit	including	the	government	sector	that	has	to	play	role	in	regulating	such	issues	as	quickly	and	as	possible	in	keeping	up	with	the	leapfrog	development	of	technology
otherwise	there	could	be	far	reaching	consequences	for	society	if	the	use	of	such	technology	is	not	regulated
forecasting	trends	and	future	trends	in	the	near	future	it	will	be	difficult	for	artificial	intelligence	to	be	replaced	by	technology	like	chatgpt
the	trend	is	to	develop	such	system	to	be	able	to	use	more	languages	more	accurately
the	chatgpt	system	currently	processes	messages	mainly
and	display	results	in	conversational	form	but	in	the	future	ai	will	not	create	conversations	that	are	just	text
but	can	be	displayed	in	the	form	of	photographs	painting	or	even	sound	which	should	be	continuously	developed	to	be	more	accurate	than	today
such	developments	may	affect	user	behavior	as	well
consequently	there	has	been	concern	in	both	academia	and	other	industries	that	chatgpt	users	should	use	them	in	socially	responsible	manner
to	meet	the	main	purpose	of	ai	technology	in	facilitating	users	with	maximum	efficiency

who	does	the	business	of	exporting	products	to	foreign	countries
have	you	ever	wondered	whether	each	financial	transaction	or	export	of	industrial	products	such	as	electronic	parts	automotive	parts	sensors	and	lasers	aviation	equipment	marine	equipment	has	the	buyer	actually	used	the	product	in	accordance	with	the	purpose	of	the	product	or	not
an	exporter	may	have	encountered	new	customer	who	requested	large	amount	of	such	goods	but	asked	to	pay	in	cash
or	may	purchase	goods	by	having	them	shipped	to	an	unfamiliar	destination	country	including	changing	the	route	of	transporting	goods	by	change	company	address	frequently	these	are	indicators
indicators	red	flags	that	the	exporter	suspects	may	be	at	risk	of	being	involved	in	the	business	of	terrorist	groups
the	company	we	are	doing	business	with	may	be	front	company
this	is	associated	with	the	proliferation	of	weapons	of	mass	destruction	wmd	where	terrorist	groups	are	willing	to	pay	large	sums	for	dual	use	items	dui
to	be	produced	or	modified	into	weapons
these	are	the	reasons	why	thai	entrepreneurs	should	pay	close	attention	to	routine	inspections	of	industrial	goods	traded	for	dui	including	customer	and	end	use	inspections
to	prevent	their	companies	from	being	involved	in	terrorism	or	money	laundering	in	the	future
what	are	dual	use	items	dui
dual	use	items	dui	are	items	that	can	be	used	for	both	commercial	and	military	applications
which	when	the	entrepreneur	sells	such	products	the	destination	can	use	the	goods	for	general	trade
but	it	could	be	related	to	chemical	biological	or	nuclear	weapons
dui	infiltrates	many	industries	including	the	automotive	industry
electronics	aviation	marine	equipment	sensors	and	lasers	examples	of	dui	products	such	as	ball	bearings	are	often	components	of	machinery	in	heavy	industrial	plants
in	the	hands	of	terrorists	it	could	be	used	as	component	of	nuclear	weapons
carbon	fibers	typically	used	in	sports	equipment	such	as	tennis	rackets	can	be	component	of	carbon	dioxide	generator
corona	virus	coronavirus	is	also	dual	use	product
because	it	can	be	vaccine	or	can	be	made	into	biological	weapon
two	way	product	how	is	it	important	to	entrepreneurs	in	running	business
although	at	present	the	government	has	not	yet	imposed	measures	to	obtain	approval	for	the	export	of	goods	and	technologies	related	to	dui	but	entrepreneurs	in	every	industry	should	know	whether	the	goods	produced	or	exported	are	dui	or	not	because	such	goods	are	regarded	as	it	is	random	product	that	is	associated	with	terrorism
and	if	the	company	does	not	audit	end	customers	regarding	use	and	end	users	end	use	and	end	user	screening
penalties	may	be	imposed	under	the	controlling	goods	related	to	the	proliferation	of	weapons	of	mass	destruction	act	of	in	addition	in	terrorist	groups	such	as	the	taliban	al	qaeda	and	al	qaeda
are	also	often	linked	to	money	laundering	in	acquiring	weapons	related	to	weapons	of	mass	destruction	wmd
therefore	companies	that	do	not	have	an	internal	compliance	program	icp	to	verify	customers	before	making	commercial	transactions
including	financial	transactions	they	may	also	be	subject	to	penalties	for	money	laundering	under	the	anti	terrorism	and	proliferation	of	weapons	of	mass	destruction	financing	act
how	can	companies	prevent	involvement	in	terrorism	and	the	spread	of	weapons	of	mass	destruction	wmd
companies	should	focus	on	having	internal	compliance	program	icp	which	is	an	international	system	to	prevent	companies	from	getting	involved	in	the	spread	of	wmd
the	main	prevention	methods	are	as	follows	check	if	the	company	has	exported	dui	or	not
entrepreneurs	can	preliminarily	check	whether	the	goods	they	have	are	dui	or	not	through	the	website	of	the	department	of	foreign	trade
ministry	of	commerce	which	can	be	entered	as	search	term	customs	tariff	hs	code	or	chemical	number	cas	number	at	the	website
end	use	and	end	user	screening	before	trading	with	new	international	clients	the	company	should	verify	that	the	customer	list	is	in	the	database	of	individuals	or	groups	involved	in	the	spread	of	wmd	which	can	be	verified	on	the	united	nations	security	council	consolidated	list
at	the	website	check	whether	the	customer	is	in	the	database	related	to	money	laundering	or	not
amlo	has	published	list	of	people	who	are	designated	under	the	prevention	and	suppression	of	financing	of	terrorism	and	proliferation	of	weapons	of	mass	destruction	act
so	before	trading	with	customers	the	company	should	also	check	the	list	of	customers	in	the	database	of	persons	involved	in	money	laundering	under	the	act
you	can	search	the	information	of	the	designated	person	at	for	exporters	scb	offers	the	scb	trade	club	platform	system	that	helps	centralize	data	to	make	it	easier	for	entrepreneurs	to	manage	external	data

skin	is	like	garment	of	the	body
especially	the	facial	skin	it	is	more	important	as	it	reflects	the	beauty	and	youth
therefore	facial	treatment	is	another	routine	that	both	men	and	women	pay	attention	to
many	people	invest	in	thousands	of	thousands	of	expensive	skincare	products	to	maintain	the	youthfulness	of	their	faces
but	do	you	know	that	actually	the	natural	essential	oil	is	another	great	option	for	moisturizing	protection
it	creates	radiance	to	the	skin	as	well
it	also	safe	from	chemicals	because	it	extracted	from	natural	ingredients
importantly	it	cheaper	than	many	well	known	brands	of	skin	care	creams	but	many	people	are	afraid	and	think	that	using	oil	to	nourish	their	skin	will	make	their	skin	too	oily	or	cause	acne
and	not	at	all	using	the	right	oil	for	your	skin	type	will	help	reduce	oiliness	and	reduce	the	clogging	of	pores	that	can	cause	acne	breakouts
today	we	have	oil	or	facial	oil	that	is	suitable	for	each	skin	type	to	leave	each	other
oily	skin	jojoba	oil	is	lightweight	oil
it	has	the	ability	to	reduce	excess	oil	on	the	face	while	moisturizing	create	balance	for	the	skin	at	the	same	time
grape	seed	oil	is	great	oil	for	oily	skin
because	there	are	substances	that	reduce	oil	production	of	the	skin
thus	reducing	the	oiliness	of	the	skin	very	well	and	just	the	skin	to	return	to	balance	without	fear	of	oily	skin
it	is	lighter	than	jojoba	oil
dry	skin	almond	oil	is	highly	hydrating	but	gentle	oil	for	dry	sensitive	skin	suitable	for	dry	to	very	dry	skin
it	is	also	high	in	vitamin	vitamin	is	precursor	to	retinol	which	can	reduce	fine	lines	and	wrinkles
marula	oil	is	an	oil	that	is	quickly	absorbed	into	the	skin	by	gently	massaging	the	skin
due	to	its	intense	moisture	it	protects	the	skin	from	dehydration	and	maintains	the	skin	moisture	throughout	the	day
acne	prone	skin	pomegranate	seed	oil	has	natural	antibacterial	effect
thereby	reducing	bacteria	in	the	pores	and	preventing	inflammation	of	acne	and	facial	skin
it	is	also	light	oil	that	does	not	cause	clogging
rosehip	oil	is	very	suitable	for	skin	with	inflamed	acne	red	rashes
rosehip	oil	moisturizes	the	skin	at	deep	level	but	does	not	clog	pores	helping	to	reduce	acne	dark	spots	redness	from	acne
theres	test	of	using	rosehip	oil	for	weeks	in	row	and	found	that	it	really	helped	to	reduce	acne	on	his	face
normal	skin	argan	oil	many	people	call	argan	oil	versatile	oil
moisturizing	the	skin
prevents	oil	from	evaporating	from	the	skin
and	absorbed	into	the	skin	quickly	contains	high	amounts	of	vitamin	contains	free	radicals	that	protects	the	skin	from	being	damaged	by	pollution	both	dark	spots	and	small	wrinkles	make	the	skin	soft	and	gentle
retinol	oils	help	smooth	bright	and	reduce	the	appearance	of	fine	lines	and	wrinkles
moisturizing	the	skin
but	not	irritating	it	is	recommended	to	use	at	night	after	applying	moisturizer
sensitive	skin	moringa	oil	moringa	oil	is	an	oil	rich	in	antioxidants	helps	protect	skin	from	side	effects
it	has	the	right	amount	of	oil	to	help	retain	moisture	on	the	skin	as	well	reduce	irritation
it	lightweight	but	hydrating	oil	that	just	right	for	the	skin	can	be	used	before	makeup	without	making	the	face	oily
aloe	vera	oil	is	rich	in	antioxidants	and	substances	that	reduce	irritation	including	substances	that	help	reduce	acne	causing	bacteria
therefore	this	oil	is	suitable	for	sensitive	and	acne	prone	skin
you	can	see	that	we	can	create	beautiful	skin	with	natural	extracts	but	different	oils
these	are	not	ghost	pills	that	will	immediately	solve	the	problem
especially	if	anyone	has	serious	skin	problems	such	as	sagging	deep	floating	streaks
if	you	want	to	be	beautiful	quickly	you	need	to	use	various	beauty	technologies	from	beauty	clinic	as	helper

the	youngest	and	newest	generation	in	the	world	is	alpha	generation	or	simply	called	alpha	gen	itself
alpha	gen	is	child	born	between	and	or	when	compared	to	gen	who	had	just	graduated	and	entered	the	early	working	age	the	oldest	generation	of	gen	alpha	is	still	in	its	infancy	as	of
gen	alpha	is	the	offspring	of	gen	who	are	often	older	parents	having	little	ones	therefore	those	children	are	wealthy	without	having	to	struggle	as	much	as	other	models
they	experience	digital	devices	and	technology	since	birth
they	study	lot	study	for	long	time	and	have	variety	live	in	capitalist	society
therefore	they	tend	to	be	materialistic	people	accustomed	to	change	easily	bored	has	low	patience
this	young	generation	only	knows	society	with	technology
born	in	an	era	of	competition	until	some	offices	call	this	child	alpha	generation	the	ipad	generation
they	learn	and	use	technology	almost	from	birth	and	grew	up	with	the	skills	to	use	technology	effectively
this	generation	has	an	average	internet	usage	rate	of	per	day	and	has	tendency	to	increase	steadily	which	encourages	children	of	this	age	to	be	group	of	people	who	will	have	great	potential	in	the	future	it	genius	who	can	use	technology	smarter
they	accept	and	understand	the	difference
because	he	grew	up	in	world	without	borders	including	being	generation	that	started	to	have	the	same	culture	as	together	all	over	the	world
in	addition	they	are	also	able	to	adapt	to	various	changes	well	because	they	were	born	in	an	era	where	the	world	changes	very	quickly
society	must	be	prepared	and	use	the	potential	of	this	new	generation	to	understand	their	nature
alpha	gen	children	use	technology	to	work	best	and	are	much	more	agile	than	other	generations
because	they	were	born	in	the	age	of	perfect	digital
moreover	this	generation	will	have	low	concentration	on	things	that	they	are	not	interested	in
but	they	will	concentrate	highly	on	technology	as	well	as	having	good	data	acquisition	and	data	analysis	skills
and	this	generation	will	be	able	to	create	new	innovations	better	than	other	gens	in	the	past	because	he	was	born	in	an	era	where	innovation	is	easy	for	everyone	all	genders	and	ages	types	of	careers	that	alpha	gen	people	are	interested	in	are	as	follow	content	creation	including	writing	making	videos	for	various	channels	which	can	generate	lot	of	income
but	it	depends	on	their	skills	and	creativity	such	as	being	youtuber	blogger	vlogger	etc
this	is	space	where	they	can	express	themselves	in	unique	way
it	is	platform	to	release	energy	and	creativity	as	well	as	their	opinions	on	the	world	and	society

social	creator	this	generation	will	live	according	to	their	own	preferences	and	needs
because	they	have	both	full	knowledge	and	ability
at	the	same	time	there	is	interest	in	wanting	to	be	part	of	creating	better	world
therefore	there	is	tendency	for	this	generation	to	turn	to	work	to	solve	social	problems	environment	and	volunteer	work	to	help	people	such	as	social	innovation	developers	to	drive	change	both	nationally	and	globally	parenting	in	the	digital	age	or	the	generation	of	alpha	generation	children	the	way	of	parenting	and	the	role	of	parents	must	change	to	keep	up	with	the	changes

many	people	may	have	questions
individuals	who	have	income	are	already	filing	taxes	every	year	why	do	they	have	to	pay	half	year	tax	again
only	those	with	certain	incomes	are	eligible	for	the	half	year	tax
that	is	paying	taxes	for	half	this	year	is	relief	from	the	tax	burden
because	if	there	is	no	filing	of	the
or	half	year	personal	income	tax	return	individuals	must	file	personal	income	tax	returns	and	pay	large	amounts	of	tax
however	the	amount	paid	can	be	used	to	deduct	from	the	calculated	annual	tax
for	example	mr	has	filed	return	and	paid	half	year	personal	income	tax	of	baht
at	the	end	of	the	year	he	calculates	the	tax	that	must	be	paid	in	the	amount	of	baht
so	he	will	pay	an	additional	tax	of	only	baht	baht

in	addition	to	filing	annual	personal	taxes	there	is	another	group	of	income	that	must	be	taxed	in	the	middle	of	the	year	through	filing
form	or	return	for	personal	income	tax	filing
for	non	salary	income	from	january	to	june	the	tax	must	be	filed	between	july	and	september

to	subtract
who	is	required	to	submit	por	ngor	dor	form
those	who	must	submit
form	are	individuals	having	income	according	to	the	tax	law	section	which	are	category	money	or	benefits	derived	from	renting	properties	such	as	land	houses	cars	etc
category	income	from	independent	professions	such	as	law	practice	of	the	art	of	healing	engineering	architecture	accounting	fine	arts	or	other	independent	professions	category	income	from	contracts	that	provide	essential	baggage	other	than	equipment
category	income	income	from	business	commerce	agriculture	industry	transportation	or	other	things	other	than	those	specified	in	income	categories	can	not	file	personal	income	tax	for	half	year
failure	to	file	taxes	will	be	punished	by	law	which	is	fine	of	baht	and	an	additional	fee	interest	from	the	tax	that	must	be	paid	at	rate	of	per	month	fraction	of	month	is	equal	to	month	starting	from	the	th	september	onwards
in	summary	what	everyone	needs	to	know	as	an	individual	is	to	file	half	year	personal	income	tax	within	the	period	specified	by	law
because	filing	semi	annual	taxes	is	not	burden
but	it	is	duty	and	something	that	everyone	should	know	and	understand	in	order	to	file	and	pay	taxes	correctly
if	we	use	appropriately	credit	card	instead	of	cash	we	will	gain	various	benefits
installment	promotion	or	various	discount	benefits	attached	to	that	credit	card	or	interest	free	period	for	paying	on	time
but	for	those	who	use	credit	cards	and	like	to	pay	at	least	let	see	how	does	frequent	minimum	credit	card	payments	affect	us
the	interest	calculation	starts	from	the	date	of	spending
if	we	choose	to	pay	minimum	on	credit	card	interest	amounts	will	be	charged
the	first	amount	will	be	charged	from	the	spending	balance	from	the	first	day	until	the	due	date	and	the	second	amount	is	the	interest	on	the	balance	after	the	minimum	payment	from	the	date	we	pay	the	minimum	until	the	closing	date	of	next	month
if	we	regularly	pay	the	minimum	of	course	interest	rates	must	continue	to	rise	undeniably
interest	is	charged	from	the	date	the	minimum	payment	is	made	but	actually	interest	starts	on	the	day	we	spend	it
no	interest	free	period
usually	credit	card	providers	offer	interest	free	periods	to	their	card	holders	from	the	first	day	of	spending	until	the	payment	due	date
if	we	plan	to	prepare	money	for	full	amount	payment	we	will	benefit	from	this	period
it	is	credit	usage	instead	of	cash	which	helps	to	increase	liquidity	without	paying	interest
but	if	we	choose	to	pay	the	minimum	credit	card	the	right	to	use	the	interest	free	period	will	expire	immediately
and	we	have	to	pay	interest	from	the	first	day	of	spending	which	will	cause	the	interest	in	that	accounting	period	to	increase
longer	installments	higher	interest	rate
once	we	choose	paying	the	minimum	credit	card	of	course	we	will	have	longer	debt	because	the	principal	that	was	spent	firstly	cannot	be	cleared	completely	as	scheduled	which	resulted	in	an	increase	in	interest
and	if	we	continue	to	use	credit	cards	with	the	minimum	pay	on	credit	card	every	month	the	amount	of	debt	and	interest	will	increase	until	it	becomes	large	debt
it	causes	longer	debt	to	pay	off	and	the	chances	of	getting	out	of	the	debt	cycle	will	be	even	more	difficult
signs	of	over	indebtedness
the	minimum	monthly	credit	card	payment	is	one	of	the	warning	signs	that	we	are	not	able	to	manage	expenses	as	planned
that	points	out	that	we	have	more	expenses	than	we	earn	so	we	should	stop	using	credit	cards	first	to	clear	up	less	debt
but	if	we	continue	to	use	the	card	and	pay	the	minimum	the	interest	will	increase	which	incur	an	excess	debt
finally	even	the	minimum	payment	becomes	more	difficult	spoil	the	credit	and	may	have	to	pay	more	interest	and	various	fines	affecting	daily	life
after	spending	via	credit	card	every	month	it	is	important	that	we	plan	to	pay	back	the	full	amount	when	the	payment	is	due	in	order	to	get	the	most	benefits	of	the	credit	card	usage	and	does	not	create	any	future	spending	problems

have	you	ever	heard	that	some	people	who	are	health	conscious	eat	only	fruits	and	vegetables	chicken	breasts	lean	meat	protein	from	eggs	and	grains	drink	fruit	juice	extract	and	exercise	regularly
but	why	are	they	still	sick
in	addition	some	people	are	suffering	from	cancer
dr	danai	teewanda	deputy	director	general	of	the	department	of	health	has	said	that	eating	vegetables	regularly	is	good	for	health
but	what	is	worrisome	is	problems	with	chemical	or	pesticide	residues
which	is	harmful	to	the	body	for	safety	therefore	should	pay	special	attention	to	washing	vegetables	thoroughly
consumers	should	therefore	consider	the	safety	of	eating	vegetables	before	eating	or	cooking	vegetables
must	be	cleaned	every	time	according	to	the	chemical	residue	test	in	vegetables	sold	in	the	market	it	was	found	that	types	of	vegetables	had	high	levels	of	pesticide	residues
including	cantonese	kale	yard	long	beans	chili	cucumber	chinese	cabbage	chinese	morning	glory	eggplant	cabbage	and	coriander
in	addition	fresh	vegetables	were	also	found	coli	and	salmonella	contamination
such	as	lettuce	parsley	basil	mint	spring	onion	cilantro	cabbage	asiatic	leaf	green	beans	and	cucumber	which	causes	food	poisoning	as	well
diseases	that	come	with	toxic	contaminated	vegetables	acutely	ill	chronically	ill	most	come	from	exposure	to	pesticide	contaminants
if	received	in	small	quantities	will	gradually	accumulate	in	the	body
how	to	buy	vegetables	and	fruits	safely	how	to	wash	fruits	and	vegetables	to	reduce	pesticide	residues	there	are	also	ways	to	reduce	pesticide	residues	such	as	peeling	the	fruit	or	peeling	off	the	outer	leaves	of	leaves	because	the	chemicals	will	remain	on	the	outer	bark	or	leaves
or	blanching	boiling	vegetables	it	will	help	reduce	chemical	residues
therefore	eating	fruits	and	vegetables	are	beneficial	to	health	but	there	should	be	method	of	washing	to	reduce	pesticide	residues	it	will	help	people	who	eat	vegetables	and	fruits	far	away	from	disease

money	has	the	power	to	change	everything	around	us	including	family	relationships
obviously	money	has	the	ability	to	make	relations	strong	happy	and	even	havoc	too
it	has	been	central	reason	for	the	collapse	and	ruin	of	several	family	relations
nowadays	family	relationships	are	money	based	and	people	love	each	other	for	their	own	gains
coming	to	money	vs	relationship	the	money	is	just	an	artificial	token	that	gives	temporary	happiness
but	relations	can	be	bought	or	sold
these	days	people	just	concentrate	to	earn	money	and	this	results	in	having	less	time	to	spend	with	those	who	care	about	them
basically	having	lot	of	money	is	great	but	if	you	don	earn	in	right	way	by	balancing	working	time	with	spending	time	with	friends	and	family	you	will	not	be	able	to	be	happy	in	our	life
the	most	important	thing	in	our	life	is	to	have	good	relationship	with	family	and	friends	to	maximize	our	level	of	happiness
not	only	happiness	but	also	relations	help	us	in	character	formation	emotional	strengthening	and	they	re	the	ones	to	accept	our	good	and	bad
although	without	money	and	wealth	life	seems	difficult	but	much	focussing	to	earn	money	affects	our	mental	health	satisfaction	and	damages	precious	relationships
from	point	of	view	we	could	say	that	money	symbolizes	our	shadowy	side
we	project	all	our	unconscious	relationships	to	values	and	self	worth	onto	the	amount	of	money	we	earn	or	feel	we	ought	to	earn
we	may	find	ourselves	slaves	to	money	organizing	our	whole	lives	around	making	more	and	more	or	we	may	wonder	why	money	never	seems	to	come	our	way	perhaps	suspecting	that	deep	down	we	are	not	worthy	of	more
either	way	the	triangular	relationship	we	have	between	money	values	and	our	self	worth	is	hugely	revealing
it	is	also	relationship	heavily	intertwined	with	our	society	and	culture
take	bankers
we	might	both	admire	and	despise	the	wealth	greed	is	good
although	we	say	that	money	is	just	tool	of	exchange
but	in	reality	money	is	vital	force	in	life
build	stability	build	power	create	freedom	comfort	and	so	much	more	in	our	lives
we	might	instinctively	know	that	money	doesnt	make	us	happy	and	that	beyond	certain	point	our	happiness	stops	rising	with	our	income	various	studies	have	come	up	with	different	levels	of	where	this	peaks
and	this	knowledge	has	been	proven	by	what	is	known	as	the	hedonic	treadmill	psychological	theory	that	shows	the	more	money	an	individual	makes	the	more	their	expectations	and	desires	rise	in	tandem	with	that	increase	in	income	which	results	in	no	permanent	gain	of	happiness	at	all
the	british	psychologist	oliver	james	claims	there	is	an	epidemic	sweeping	through	the	english	speaking	world	that	he	calls	affluenza
in	his	book	he	claims	the	richer	we	become	materially	the	poorer	we	become	psychologically	and	emotionally
according	to	his	research	mass	materialism	is	making	us	twice	as	prone	to	depression	anxiety	and	addiction
indeed	this	idea	that	materialism	makes	us	miserable	has	been	around	for	many	years
the	social	philosopher	and	psychoanalyst	dr	erich	fromm	wrote	healthy	economy	is	only	possible	at	the	expense	of	unhealthy	human	beings	yes	our	relationship	with	money	is	indeed	complex	one
as	the	jungian	analyst	james	hillman	wrote	in	his	essay	contribution	to	soul	and	money	money	problems	are	inevitable	necessary	irreducible	always	present	and	potentially	if	not	actually	overwhelming
money	is	devilishly	divine	he	goes	onto	say	that	money	can	be	taken	spiritually	or	materially	but	which	in	itself	is	neither	and	that	if	money	divides	the	two	realms	is	it	also	that	third	which	holds	them	together	hillman	is	touching	on	very	raw	nerve	can	be	paid	well	want	nice	things	and	be	good	person
in	this	he	seems	to	be	suggesting	that	money	and	soul	must	be	explored	together
that	we	cannot	keep	dividing	the	material	from	the	spiritual	and	that	to	fully	explore	ourselves	we	must	look	inwards	to	explore	our	relationship	with	money
as	we	look	towards	the	festive	season	with	all	its	inherent	contradictions	between	the	spiritual	and	the	material	perhaps	there	is	no	finer	time	to	begin	the	exploration

theres	strong	impact	on	many	careers	leading	to	income	loss	and	unemployment	but	some	careers	are	on	the	rise	during	covid	because	people	are	well	adjusted	swiftly	and	can	make	lot	of	money

in	thailand	virtual	bank	is	under	comprehensive	study	of	all	dimensions	such	as	the	objective	impact	and	potential	risks

when	the	scb	head	office	announced	that	employees	could	work	from	home	we	saw	different	reactions	from	our	coworkers
most	of	them	preferred	it	because	they	didnt	want	to	get	too	close	to	their	co	workers	for	fear	of	coming	down	with	covid
some	people	liked	it	because	it	allowed	them	to	change	their	everyday	environment	and	routine
those	with	families	were	relieved	to	be	able	to	look	after	their	children	during	the	school	holidays
singles	complained	of	being	bored	because	they	were	unable	to	leave	their	homes	and	were	faced	with	paying	higher	electricity	bills	because	of	all	the	electrical	utilities	they	were	using	during	their	workday
whatever	their	reaction	the	majority	liked	it	at	first	because	they	didnt	have	to	get	up	early
however	they	soon	found	that	working	at	the	office	is	sometimes	more	convenient	because	of	all	the	office	equipment	available	and	you	can	easily	communicate	discuss	or	schedule	meetings	with	people	face	to	face

when	you	re	at	work	you	may	not	get	chance	to	use	these	applications	very	much
your	new	home	setting	helps	you	to	stay	up	to	date	with	current	events	and	learn	from	new	experiences

instead	they	have	to	rely	on	convenience	stores	or	street	food

working	from	home	lowers	these	costs	and	provides	an	opportunity	to	save	money	for	savings	or	investment
it	obvious	that	working	from	home	has	lot	of	benefits	during	crisis
however	when	operating	from	home	you	must	be	disciplined	and	maintain	your	sense	of	duty
you	must	also	keep	track	of	your	productivity	and	report	your	progress	and	accomplishments	to	superiors	on	regular	basis	to	update	your	performance
this	is	habit	that	will	help	us	happily	survive	the	covid	crisis
nowadays	various	commerce	online	shopping	advertisements	are	enticing	us	every	day	whether	on	facebook	instagram	or	other	websites
each	deal	is	so	well	priced	it	so	tempting	that	you	can	help	but	buy	it
necessary	or	not	we	don	know	but	the	price	is	good
it	pity	if	you	let	it	slip	away
buying	behavior	suddenly	because	the	deal	is	tempting	will	destroy	your	pocket	money	or	expenses	that	month
how	much	depends	on	that	product	how	expensive	is	it
how	often	do	you	buy	unnecessary
if	you	have	enough	money	in	your	pocket	and	the	purchase	doesn	affect	your	monthly	expenses
and	you	are	happy	with	your	shopping	that	might	not	have	any	serious	consequences
but	on	the	other	hand	if	only	you	change	your	unnecessarily	gullible	behavior	just	because	the	price	is	good
unnecessary	spending	can	be	used	to	pay	off	debts	or	be	saved	for	things	you	really	need	in	the	future
today	we	re	going	to	introduce	the	day	rule	to	use	as	tool	to	control	your	spending	to	make	the	most	of	it
the	day	rule	is	simple	method
that	helps	you	control	your	expenses	and	choose	the	right	shopping
most	importantly	if	you	want	to	buy	something	that	you	don	need
this	rule	tells	you	to	stop	buying	it	whether	it	online	or	in	store
you	will	remove	yourself	from	that	website
or	walk	out	of	the	store	immediately	the	next	step	is	to	make	list	of	what	you	want	to	buy
along	with	the	source	that	can	buy	the	product	with	price
enter	purchase	dates	and	save	in	your	calendar	what	you	ll	need	to	buy	in	days	and	how	you	ll	manage	your	purchases
in	days	you	will	have	time	to	figure	out	if	you	really	need	to	buy	those	things	is	it	just	need	or	is	it	necessary
thoughtful	purchase	is	not	an	instantaneous	purchase
besides	giving	you	time	to	think	this	technique	also	gives	you	time	to	compare	prices	between	individual	sellers	after	you	ve	decided	that	that	what	you	really	want	to	buy
make	it	possible	to	buy	at	price	that	is	worth	saving	more	money
which	has	time	to	think	most	of	them	will	make	it	clear	that	you	don	need	as	many	products	as	you	initially	thought
that	saves	you	more	money	because	you	know	in	fact	with	mindfulness
ponder	you	don	really	need	that
the	day	rule	cuts	down	on	spending	on	things	that	are	simply	wanted	but	not	necessary
you	will	have	time	to	choose	where	to	buy	for	the	best	price
or	if	your	car	runs	out	of	gas	of	course	you	need	to	fill	it	up	in	the	morning	before	you	go	to	work
or	you	must	eat	dinner	but	the	stuff	in	the	fridge	is	gone
you	must	buy	food	but	it	doesn	have	to	be	lobsters	or	expensive	imported	steaks
for	luxury	goods	expensive	it	clearly	just	need
buying	new	shoulder	bag	even	though	you	already	have	many	bags	of	different	sizes
or	the	need	to	buy	another	pair	of	new	colored	shoes	while	you	have	many	pairs	of	similar	shoes	but	different	colors	but	sometimes	it	hard	to	decide	if	it	just	what	you	want	or	needs
for	example	if	you	have	an	appointment	for	job	interview	do	you	need	to	buy	new	outfit
if	you	already	have	the	right	clothes	but	there	are	new	clothes	at	good	price	and	you	think	you	ll	feel	more	confident	wearing	them
in	this	case	it	would	make	more	sense	for	you	to	decide	whether	to	buy	new	one
or	wear	an	old	dress	in	days	instead	of	making	the	decision	in	days	which	would	be	too	late
simply	put	the	day	rule	is	way	to	help	you	spend	only	what	you	need
but	it	not	limited	to	just	factor	health	or	just	safety
after	applying	the	day	rule	when	choosing	what	you	want	or	just	need	in	the	next	step	besides	just	writing	down	the	list	of	purchases
any	unused	money	from	buying	unnecessary	things	should	be	used	as	savings
in	the	future	you	will	see	your	savings	grow
when	you	see	your	savings	grow	this	will	reduce	the	desire	to	buy	unnecessary	things	as	well
because	you	will	start	to	enjoy	seeing	your	savings	keep	growing
automatically	deduct	your	savings	into	your	savings	account
by	deducting	from	the	salary	account	into	the	savings	account	every	month	set	savings	goal
and	regularly	check	if	your	savings	are	meeting	your	goals	or	not
if	the	target	is	still	not	met	the	spending	must	be	adjusted
by	going	back	and	looking	at	the	day	list	to	see	if	there	is	anything	you	want	to	buy	or	not
on	the	other	hand	if	there	are	luxury	items	that	you	really	want	to	buy
but	the	product	exceeds	your	budget
may	consider	earning	extra	or	cutting	off	other	unnecessary	products	to	have	enough	savings	to	buy	things	of	high	value
use	your	mind	and	take	time	to	think	carefully
what	is	necessary	or	is	it	just	want
you	will	have	enough	money	for	the	whole	month	and	more	money	left	over	for	savings
save	with	scb	long	term	deposit	account	to	grow	your	savings	and	by	using	automatic	debits	from	your	payroll	to	force	yourself	to	save	consistently
in	the	end	you	ll	be	happy	to	see	your	savings	keep	growing

in	the	new	normal	online	shopping	or	commerce	is	becoming	tremendously	popular
this	has	made	physical	stores	like	shops	supermarkets	or	department	stores	adjust	themselves	to	use	technology	to	create	new	experience	facilitate	customers	with	faster	and	easier	shopping	channels	and	be	competitive	in	the	digital	world
here	is	good	sample	of	using	technology	to	elevate	the	shopping	experience	of	customers	in	supermarket	in	chiba	province	near	tokyo
this	supermarket	has	launched	smart	shopping	cart	equipping	monitor	and	barcode	connected	to	the	prepaid	cards	so	customers	can	check	the	price	before	adding	product	to	the	cart
the	products	added	to	the	cart	will	appear	on	the	monitor	so	buyers	know	the	total	price	in	their	cart	all	the	time	if	the	price	exceeds	their	budget
besides	ai	artificial	intelligence	is	used	to	analyze	purchasing	behavior	of	each	customer	so	the	system	can	introduce	other	potential	products	to	that	customer	on	the	monitor
the	supermarket	also	installs	closed	circuit	cameras	throughout	the	store	to	check	shelf	stock	and	fill	the	shelves	immediately	when	needed	and	to	monitor	if	customers	find	products	easily
after	finish	shopping	customers	can	leave	the	supermarket	without	queuing	for	payment	at	the	cashier
its	touchless	experience	as	cash	or	credit	card	payment	is	not	needed
the	purchase	amount	will	be	deducted	from	the	prepaid	card	right	away
that	practice	is	in	line	with	the	covid	situation	when	people	avoid	touching	money	or	contacting	others	especially	in	japan	where	the	elderly	are	at	high	risk	for	death	from	covid
another	sample	is	dash	cart	amazons	smart	shopping	cart	equipped	with	touch	screen	monitor	sensor	camera	and	algorithm
those	functions	can	tell	which	products	are	added	to	the	cart	including	price
customers	can	see	the	price	per	item	including	the	total	price
to	start	using	dash	cart	once	the	cart	is	available	the	system	will	send	qr	code	to	the	amazon	app	and	then	customers	just	sign	in	and	start	using	the	cart
the	system	will	link	amazon	account	and	credit	card	to	dash	cart	and	also	link	to	alexa	to	see	shopping	list
more	customers	can	scan	discount	coupons	if	available
after	finish	shopping	the	system	will	deduct	the	purchase	amount	through	credit	card	linked	to	the	amazon	account	promptly	and	the	receipt	will	be	sent	to	customers	via	email
that	process	is	called	just	walk	out	which	means	purchasing	products	and	leaving	without	touching	anything	or	contacting	anyone

many	people	face	hair	fall	and	hair	loss	problems	which	destroy	confidence	and	personality
the	factors	that	affect	hair	growth	include	hair	root	and	scalp
the	solutions	for	hair	fall	and	hair	root	start	with	nourishing	hair	root	and	scalp	which	we	can	simply	do	that	on	our	own
consume	basic	food	groups	focus	on	high	protein	food	such	as	fish	soybean	tofu	as	protein	is	an	essential	nutrient	for	hair
we	should	consume	about	grams	of	protein	or	of	all	daily	nutrients
drink	enough	water	avoid	food	containing	monosodium	glutamate	or	flavor	enhancer	avoid	drinking	alcohol	and	smoking	cigarettes
dont	lose	weight	with	fasting	but	choose	proper	meal	proportions
consume	food	rich	in	biotin	to	boost	hair	growth	biotin	is	also	known	as	vitamin	helps	burning	fat	and	builds	amino	acids	as	unit	of	protein
hair	begins	growing	from	root	in	the	bottom	of	the	follicle	and	the	main	component	of	hair	is	protein
therefore	we	should	consume	protein	rich	food	and	complement	it	with	biotin	as	it	will	enhance	the	body	to	use	protein	to	grow	hair	cells	more	effectively
take	mg	biotin	per	day	which	can	be	purchased	at	the	general	drugstore
alternatively	you	may	consume	biotin	rich	foods	such	as	almond	walnut	egg	yolk	milk	and	cheese	pork	and	liver	salmon	and	sardine	and	avocado
exercise	regularly	to	increase	blood	flow	throughout	the	body	massage	your	hair	with	your	fingertips	regularlyto	increase	blood	circulation	over	the	head
avoid	being	stressed	and	calm	your	mind	to	help	to	balance	body	hormones	naturally
hormone	balance	has	an	essential	role	in	hair	growth
bend	your	head	down	and	massage	your	head	lightly	for	minutes	per	day
do	that	regularly	every	day
in	that	way	your	hair	root	gets	full	and	essential	nutrients	from	blood	flow
wash	your	hair	properly	and	only	once	per	day
do	not	scratch	or	rub	your	hair	harshly	to	avoid	hair	infection
while	washing	use	your	fingertips	to	gently	massage	your	hair	in	circular	motion
that	helps	to	protect	your	hair	and	scalp	and	also	boosting	the	blood	circulation	system
wash	your	hair	with	cold	water	which	is	water	at	room	temperature
warm	or	hot	water	dries	your	hair	and	scalp	hair	gets	split	ends	becomes	weak	and	hair	fall	occurs	before	time
coldwater	retains	hair	moisture	hair	is	shiny	and	healthy	so	hair	fall	will	rarely	occur
minimize	the	use	of	hair	dryer	or	hair	straightener	because	when	heat	is	transferred	to	the	hair	it	can	damage	hair	internal	structure
your	hair	will	be	brittle	and	easily	fallen	out
dont	tie	and	braid	your	hair	tightly	or	wear	the	hair	in	bun	for	too	long	as	those	hairstyles	will	weaken	your	scalp
put	coconut	oil	through	your	hair	and	scalp	leave	it	for	minutes	and	then	shampoo	your	hair
do	that	once	or	twice	week
coconut	oil	stimulates	and	regrows	hair	as	nutrients	will	absorb	in	follicles	and	hair	roots
coconut	oil	keeps	protein	and	penetrates	the	hair	so	you	will	have	healthy	hair	without	dandruff
after	washing	your	hair	let	it	dry	before	going	to	bed
sleeping	while	your	hair	is	partly	wet	will	affect	scalp	health
your	hair	will	have	an	unpleasant	smell	and	hair	fall	may	occur
with	all	those	simple	tips	you	can	reduce	the	risk	of	hair	fall	your	scalp	is	getting	healthy	and	your	hair	will	be	smooth	and	thicker
anyway	natural	ways	may	take	time	until	you	see	the	outcome
if	you	have	serious	hair	problems	and	need	quick	remedies	you	probably	have	to	rely	on	advanced	medical	treatment	such	as	laser	meso	hair	which	focuses	on	hair	root	restoration	to	stop	hair	fall	from	the	root	cause
that	treatment	combines	laser	hair	growth	technology	with	meso	therapy	which	is	prevailing	in	europe	and	america	and	is	recognized	as	the	best	top	ten	medical	technology
this	technology	will	directly	deliver	moisturizing	treatment	to	the	hair	roots	add	nutrients	to	the	hair	to	restore	hair	roots	and	regrow	hair	naturally
low	level	laser	increases	treatment	performance	and	the	circulation	of	blood	and	head	lymph	nodes	can	function	better
hair	stem	is	another	treatment	that	stimulates	the	progenitor	cells	under	the	hair	gland	to	regrow	hair	by	taking	few	drops	of	blood	from	the	patient	and	then	passing	them	through	advanced	bio	technology	to	trigger	large	number	of	growth	factors
after	that	injecting	that	fluid	into	hair	root	to	repair	its	cells	stimulate	progenitor	cells	to	produce	stem	cells	for	regrowing	hair
this	technology	helps	speed	up	hair	growth	your	hair	will	be	thicker	and	healthy
those	two	medical	treatments	cost	over	ten	thousand	baht	which	is	quite	expensive

if	you	dont	want	to	lose	your	money	youd	better	learn	how	to	catch	scammers	because	they	are	now	the	master	of	disguise
if	you	are	careless	and	far	behind	them	you	can	be	their	victim
anyway	fake	can	never	be	real	and	well	be	able	to	catch	many	suspicious	areas	if	we	are	conscious	noticeable	and	calm
here	are	some	tips	to	distinguish	an	original	product	from	counterfeit	or	to	identify	fake	and	real	matters
fraud	sms	the	criminals	nowadays	are	professional
they	send	scam	sms	to	you	on	behalf	of	bank	reliable	organization	or	your	familiar	phone	number
however	some	suspicions	are	obvious	as	the	text	messages	normally	make	you	worry	and	curious	or	create	excitement	and	contentment	as	if	youll	receive	an	award	or	privilege	and	rush	you	to	do	something	like	updating	information	otherwise	your	account	will	be	invalid	click	to	get	free	gift	seduce	you	to	click	attached	link	to	fill	in	personal	data
fake	mail	will	request	full	details	like	id	no	credit	card	no	bank	account	no	birthdate	atm	code	password	and	otp	while	the	regular	bank	asks	for	name	last	name	phone	number	and	email
if	you	accidentally	click	the	fraud	link	youll	see	strange	and	imitating	bank	websites	such	as	scbpl	com	scb	lifescb	com	scb	gdscba	com
those	are	absolutely	scam	websites
fake	website	the	official	and	reliable	website	starts	with	https	with	key	icon	in	front
once	clicked	the	system	will	pass	on	information	on	that	website	to	security	password	verify	your	right	and	the	completeness	of	the	information
for	your	confidence	you	may	check	the	url	of	the	bank	or	organization	at	first
some	urls	can	identify	the	country	where	website	is	registered	such	as	thailand	sg	singapore	uk	england	ch	china	etc
for	url	with	suffixes	such	as	com	net	or	other	without	country	suffix	you	may	check	the	website	information	at	which	identifies	where	that	website	is	registered	and	who	is	its	owner
if	it	is	an	international	website	you	should	suspect	that	it	is	fake
when	you	click	it	youll	be	asked	to	fill	in	in	depth	personal	data	like	id	no	credit	card	no	birthdate	password	otp	code
if	you	find	such	website	you	should	doubt	that	its	unusual
the	bank	generally	requests	only	basic	information	such	as	name	last	name	email	and	phone	number
fake	line	it	is	easy	to	spot	fake	lines	such	as	scb	line	which	includes	scb	thailand	and	scb	connect
the	real	identity	has	green	or	blue	shield	in	front	but	the	grey	shield	or	no	shield	is	surely	the	fake	line
fake	line	normally	starts	chatting	first	and	users	will	see	add	friends	on	top	which	means	the	user	and	this	account	havent	yet	been	friends
for	real	line	the	user	must	personally	add	friends	and	cannot	chat	with	any	customer	first	while	fake	line	is	real	conversation
most	bank	officials	dont	talk	to	customers	directly
the	language	used	in	fake	line	is	mostly	full	of	spelling	mistakes	and	blunt	sentences
customer	in	depth	data	will	be	asked	with	information	of	the	bank	where	the	customer	is	holding	link	is	attached	for	accessing	to	fraud	website	or	application	in	order	to	hack	the	victims	bank	account
if	you	receive	fake	line	please	click	report	problem	immediately	to	block	that	account
to	ensure	that	your	current	account	is	real	and	safe	you	should	add	friends	with	companies	or	brands	that	you	are	their	direct	customer	through	reliable	sources	such	as	shops	or	brand	official	accounts	to	survive	cyber	criminals
fraud	facebook	fraud	facebook	seems	like	real	one	and	its	posted	message	also	looks	real	so	you	may	not	know	that	its	fake	at	glance
anyway	fraud	is	never	genuine
if	you	carefully	notice	you	can	easily	catch	dubious	fb
the	real	fb	shows	verified	badge	or	blue	checkmark	after	the	name	and	the	spelling	of	the	page	name	must	be	correct
the	fraud	page	is	likely	to	use	imitating	names	almost	similar	to	the	real	page	but	it	contains	special	signs	like	comma	full	stop
or	unique	characters	like	english	letters	which	may	mislead	you
another	noticeable	point	is	that	the	real	number	of	bank	fb	fan	pages	is	about	million	for	example	scb	gains	million	fan	pages	while	the	fake	one	has	only	hundreds
on	real	page	each	brand	post	gains	the	average	amount	of	likes	and	comments	while	there	is	little	or	no	like	and	comments	on	fake	page	so	you	can	assume	that	its	the	imitating	page	created	by	the	scammers
spam	email	the	bank	has	no	policy	to	ask	customers	to	disclose	id	no	pin	code	or	important	information	through	email
for	an	email	that	requests	you	to	disclose	personal	data	such	as	password	bank	account	no	secret	information	or	any	email	sent	to	you	in	order	to	update	information	or	make	confirmation	statement	or	provide	the	attached	link	with	email	and	ask	you	to	click	another	website	or	send	you	an	unusual	message	please	remember	not	to	reply	that	email	and	dont	click	any	suspicious	link	or	file
just	delete	it
if	you	are	in	doubt	or	have	any	questions	please	forward	that	scam	email	to	security	scb	co	th	the	bank	will	reply	to	you	whether	it	is	phishing	email
scam	app	scam	app	is	now	spreading	widely	and	normally	comes	with	fraud	sms	or	line	with	link	for	downloading	scam	app
they	deceive	you	with	many	scammed	offers	for	example	offering	loans	with	special	interest	rates	and	you	have	to	click	the	link	for	downloading	the	loan	app
if	you	click	download	itll	take	you	to	the	app	without	direct	passing	through	app	store	play	store	or	huawei	app	gallery
more	notification	scam	app	is	mostly	specific	like	loan	app	with	unreliable	description	sometimes	in	thai	but	general	app	is	english	and	no	app	detail	given	such	as	the	number	of	reviewers	the	size	of	file	the	number	of	downloads	and	no	rating	info
no	matter	tricks	the	scammers	have	attacked	us	we	have	to	be	conscious	careful	and	observable	so	that	we	can	trace	fraudulent	offers	through	online	channels

the	covid	outbreak	in	in	thailand	continues	to	increase	and	expand	to	many	provinces	across	the	country

the	popular	trend	for	men	and	women	in	this	era	is	exercising	for	health	weight	loss	and	muscle	building
not	only	men	who	work	out	to	achieve	lean	figure	with	strong	six	pack	muscles	most	new	gen	women	also	exercise	strenuously	to	get	beautiful	muscles
did	you	know	that	only	an	exercise	cant	deliver	expecting	and	visible	results	if	you	want	to	build	more	muscle	mass	such	as	six	pack	abdominal	muscles	triceps	muscles	and	leg	muscles
your	body	needs	protein	to	build	muscles	and	to	lose	weight
consuming	enough	protein	will	make	you	feel	full	but	daily	protein	intake	from	food	such	as	meat	egg	and	milk	may	not	be	sufficient	to	build	good	muscles
thats	why	professional	exercisers	or	athletes	love	to	take	protein	supplements
one	of	the	popular	supplements	is	whey	protein	which	helps	reduce	weight	alongside	exercise	to	build	muscles
here	we	will	explore	what	whey	protein	is	all	about	and	how	it	can	create	your	perfect	body	shape
what	is	whey	protein
whey	protein	is	source	of	high	quality	protein	containing	essential	amino	acids	extracted	from	cow	milk	by	leaving	out	carbohydrates	and	fat	and	only	pure	protein	remains	and	then	passing	through	the	dry	process	to	obtain	powder
whey	protein	is	long	lasting	digestible	easy	to	mix	and	the	body	can	absorb	it	rapidly
the	health	concern	is	currently	one	of	the	most	admired	trends	so	people	exercise	more
whey	protein	has	made	great	sales	because	it	repairs	and	builds	muscles	and	the	result	is	rapidly	visible
the	amino	acids	in	whey	protein	enhance	your	muscle	fitness	increase	immunity	fight	against	bacteria	in	the	digestive	tract	and	stimulate	hormone	leptin	that	reduces	appetite	and	makes	us	feel	full	so	we	can	stay	away	from	obesity
how	many	types	are	whey	proteins
there	are	different	types	of	whey	protein	in	the	market
how	much	whey	protein	do	exercisers	need	for	building	muscles
as	known	that	whey	protein	is	popular	among	muscle	builders
people	normally	need	gram	of	protein	per	kg	weight	per	day	but	those	who	exercise	strenuously	like	weightlifting	bodybuilding	will	need	grams	of	protein	per	kg	weight	per	day
thats	why	whey	protein	becomes	the	easiest	and	safest	choice	as	its	good	source	of	essential	amino	acids	strengthens	muscles	and	protects	them	from	atrophy	while	stop	exercising	improves	exercise	tolerance	reduces	fatigue	and	injury
presently	whey	protein	is	no	longer	limited	to	muscle	builders	but	it	fits	all	exercise	lovers	as	it	repairs	worn	out	parts	of	the	body	and	is	also	appropriate	for	the	elderly	and	those	who	are	underweight	control
calculation	of	how	much	protein	your	body	needs	take	your	bodyweight	depending	on	the	degree	of	exercise	for	non	exercise	for	strenuous	exercise	for	example	woman	office	worker	who	weighs	kg	and	cant	manage	time	to	exercise	calculated	by	that	means	she	needs	grams	of	protein	per	day
how	to	consume	whey	protein	effectively	whey	protein	is	actually	like	other	natural	food	but	its	processed	to	increase	concentration	and	for	easy	consumption
whey	protein	is	type	of	milk	that	strengthens	our	body	more	than	regular	milk	but	its	not	medication
there	is	no	limit	to	take	whey	protein
you	can	consume	it	as	you	like	the	same	as	general	food	anytime
to	get	the	best	results	consume	at	least	grams	of	whey	protein	per	day	to	develop	the	condition	for	boosting	protein	production	in	your	body
those	who	take	whey	protein	bit	by	bit	about	grams	each	will	not	get	results	as	much	as	regular	intake	because	is	not	built	so	the	body	is	not	stimulated	to	get	protein	synthesis	completely	as	some	parts	may	be	taken	or	discarded
for	those	who	want	to	consume	whey	protein	more	than	grams	per	day	you	should	split	it	to	several	meals	and	take	it	grams	per	meal	so	your	body	will	get	protein	all	day
the	body	cant	absorb	all	protein	if	you	take	it	over	grams	per	meal
anyway	the	amount	of	intake	per	day	is	not	fixed
its	up	to	an	individual	and	basically	depends	on	your	weight	and	goal
the	best	consumption	is	grams	per	day
how	to	consume	whey	protein
whey	protein	can	be	mixed	with	water	juice	or	water	blended	with	carbohydrates	like	glucose
some	people	may	make	smoothies	from	whey	protein	and	juice
study	found	that	whey	protein	is	efficient	when	mixed	with	carbohydrate	and	drink	it	after	working	out	and	it	delivers	better	result	than	mix	with	water
use	water	at	room	temperature	or	cold	water	with	whey	protein
dont	use	hot	water	as	protein	may	be	coagulated	and	doesnt	provide	smooth	taste
what	is	the	best	time	to	consume	whey	protein
whey	protein	is	the	most	active	when	the	amino	acid	in	your	body	is	low
wake	up	time	its	the	period	that	our	body	rests	long	without	nutrients	feeding
if	you	take	whey	protein	at	this	time	itll	absorb	into	your	body	better	than	other	times	as	the	stomach	is	still	empty
itll	also	protect	against	muscle	breakdown
after	working	out	this	is	the	most	important	period	because	our	body	can	rest	after	strenuous	muscle	training
if	you	take	whey	protein	at	this	time	your	body	will	absorb	it	well	and	then	build	and	repair	worn	out	parts	of	your	body	faster
before	bedtime	this	is	as	important	period	as	other	times	because	our	body	is	relaxing	so	it	needs	protein	to	repair	torn	muscles	due	to	an	all	day	workout	and	therell	be	enough	protein	to	restore	our	body	while	sleeping
hungry	time	its	the	period	that	our	body	is	lacking	some	nutrients
if	you	want	to	take	whey	protein	at	this	time	you	may	make	smoothies	with	mixture	of	protein	and	fresh	fruits	as	its	easy	and	quick
how	to	consume	whey	protein	with	regular	meals	for	better	shape	most	people	take	whey	protein	with	regular	meals	for	healthy	body	and	weight	loss
consuming	food	groups	allows	the	body	to	burn	fat	more	effectively	so	we	can	consume	regular	meals	alongside	whey	protein	without	side	effects
our	body	will	get	beneficial	and	essential	nutrients	when	we	consume	enough	nutritional	food	with	whey	protein
however	dont	substitute	whey	protein	with	regular	meals	as	its	only	supplement	to	help	us	lose	weight	and	build	muscles
to	obtain	optimal	health	we	need	sufficient	food	groups	to	stay	strong	healthy	and	our	body	wont	get	hurt
to	take	care	of	ourselves	early	by	consuming	food	groups	with	essential	supplement	products	regular	exercising	and	getting	enough	sleep	will	boost	our	body	slow	down	aging	and	keep	us	away	from	diseases
for	health	protection	applying	for	health	insurance	will	help	us	live	happily	with	no	anxiety
no	matter	how	well	we	take	good	care	of	ourselves	we	may	be	at	risk	of	some	diseases

many	people	are	thinking	of	wanting	to	lose	weight	but	they	are	not	sure	if	running	will	help	them	lose	weight	or	not
because	some	said	that	they	ran	at	the	beginning	the	weight	was	reduced	but	after	running	for	long	time	the	weight	was	not	going	to	drop	again	eventually	causing	it	to	stop	running
in	fact	running	is	multi	muscular	exercise	that	helps	bring	out	more	energy	than	any	other	exercise
but	why	when	running	for	long	time	the	weight	does	not	decrease	again
the	answer	is	because	no	matter	what	type	of	exercise	is	but	if	you	repeat	the	same	pattern	for	long	time	the	body	will	begin	to	remain	or	get	used	to	it	and	no	more	development
so	when	you	run	for	while	until	you	start	to	get	used	to	it	you	should	adjust	the	way	you	run	to	stimulate	burns	more	energy	with	the	following	tips
change	running	distance	or	change	running	time	because	if	running	the	same	distance	and	at	the	same	time	your	body	learns	how	to	use	the	least	amount	of	energy	in	order	to	run	as	efficiently	as	possible	thus	creating	steady	weight
for	example	running	kilometers	per	hour	changed	to	running	kilometers	an	hour
can	increase	the	metabolic	rate	by	times	run	faster	and	further	for	example	if	you	normally	run	times	week	for	kilometers	and	speed	of	kilometers	per	hour
if	you	want	to	lose	even	more	weight	an	easy	way	is	to	speed	it	up	at	level	your	body	can	handle
or	running	at	the	same	speed	but	prolong	the	time	without	you	feeling	too	hard	or	too	tired
run	at	speed	that	is	appropriate	for	your	body	this	will	be	the	best	weight	loss	run	because	it	doesn	make	you	feel	so	tired	that	your	body	can	handle	it	so	it	can	burn	your	energy	well
rather	than	running	so	fast	that	you	can	breathe	which	does	not	cause	any	weight	loss	run	multiple	forms	in	mix	without	any	type	of	running	for	too	long	for	example	in	week	long	runs	days	of	long	runs	days	of	light	and	heavy	interval	and	run	at	consistent	speed	tempo	runs	days
it	will	help	the	body	to	develop	and	cause	continuous	weight	loss
run	light	and	heavy	it	will	help	you	lose	weight	in	the	long	term
because	regular	running	will	only	help	burn	energy	during	running
but	if	running	light	and	hard	the	body	will	continue	to	burn	after	running	as	well
for	example	running	at	normal	speed	of	kilometer	and	running	at	maximum	speed	of	seconds	alternately	and	so	on
until	you	reach	the	target	distance	set
run	with	the	right	amount	of	time	sprint	the	body	will	draw	sugar	in	the	blood	to	be	used	as	energy	for	about	minutes
then	the	body	will	pull	the	fat	to	burn
therefore	if	you	stop	running	too	fast	your	fat	will	not	be	burned	not	as	much	as	it	should
therefore	there	should	be	at	least	minutes	of	running	day
run	regularly	by	finding	your	own	middle	path	such	as	days	days	week	or	every	other	day	it	will	help	to	run	sustainably	and	see	results	in	the	long	run
for	people	who	are	just	starting	to	lose	weight	do	not	overdo	it	because	it	will	make	you	feel	tired	bored	discouraged	and	eventually	give	up	weight	training	along	with	running	weight	training	helps	to	strengthen	your	muscles	if	done	properly	will	keep	your	body	in	shape
it	helps	to	strengthen	and	increase	muscle	mass	which	is	good	for	weight	loss	because	the	more	muscles	you	have	the	more	you	burn
plus	you	can	burn	all	the	time	even	when	you	sleep
and	helps	to	run	more	endurance
switch	to	another	type	of	exercise	don	stick	to	running	alone
because	it	allows	the	body	to	train	more	and	more	forms	make	you	feel	bored	and	can	also	help	to	rest	your	legs	to	restore	the	body	makes	you	feel	more	relaxed	wear	appropriate	running	clothes	can	help	increase	the	metabolic	rate
your	body	normally	burns	fat	most	effectively	when	your	body	temperature	increases	by	degree
therefore	choosing	the	right	running	clothing	that	can	heat	the	skin	well	not	absorbing	too	much	sweat	can	also	influence	weight	loss
diet	if	running	without	dieting	it	will	not	be	thin	at	all
avoid	foods	that	are	high	in	fat	sugar	lower	in	carbohydrates
add	lots	of	protein	and	vegetables
and	you	should	drink	at	least	glasses	of	water	per	day	to	help	your	metabolism	work	better
get	enough	rest	sleep	will	allow	the	body	to	fully	repair	and	recover	itself
too	little	sleep	can	affect	weight	loss	as	well
running	can	lose	weight	and	it	can	also	be	effective	for	long	time
knowing	the	secret	to	run	will	be	successful	and	you	ll	be	able	to	see	results	without	knowing	the	right	techniques	and	you	ll	never	go	back	to	getting	fat	again
even	if	you	take	good	care	of	your	health	you	can	get	sick	whenever	you	want	so	you	should	have	health	insurance	with	you	so	you	won	have	hard	time	paying	for	your	medical	expenses

did	you	know	that	probiotics	play	an	important	role	in	enhancing	the	functioning	of	the	intestines	to	fully	absorb	the	beneficial	nutrients	into	the	body
makes	good	excretion	reduce	allergy	symptoms	cure	inflammation
it	also	has	the	effect	of	preventing	cardiovascular	disease
and	cancer	as	well
in	simple	terms	if	we	want	our	intestines	to	function	well	excrete	well	and	absorb	nutrients	that	are	beneficial
to	nourish	the	body	to	its	full	potential	probiotics	is	the	key	what	are	probiotics
probiotics	are	microorganisms
lactic	acid	bacteria	which	is	classified	as	good	group	of	microorganisms
they	can	be	found	in	foods	such	as	curd	yogurt	kimchi	miso	etc
define	probiotics	as	living	microorganisms
when	eaten	it	will	make	them	healthy
it	is	microorganism	that	is	resistant	to	acids	and	alkalis
it	can	bind	to	the	surface	of	the	intestinal	mucosa	and	produce	antimicrobial	agents	or	eliminate	other	microorganisms
including	causing	health	benefits	what	is	the	difference	between	probiotics	and	prebiotics
as	mentioned	above	probiotics	are	living	and	healthy	microorganisms
aids	in	digestion	of	prebiotics	to	stimulate	the	activity	of	good	bacteria	in	the	gut
and	help	the	good	bacteria	in	the	gut	grow	the	prebiotics	is	the	fiber	that	is	obtained	from	vegetables	and	fruits	that	are	eaten
which	when	eaten	will	not	have	any	digestion	or	absorption	when	in	the	small	intestine	but	will	be	digested	in	the	colon	with	probiotics	instead
it	is	this	prebiotic	that	helps	the	good	bacteria	in	the	gut	to	grow
as	the	intestine	contains	more	good	bacteria	the	digestive	system	works	better
prebiotics	are	obtained	through	eating	foods	such	as	fruits	vegetables	and	whole	grains
it	can	also	be	found	in	certain	foods	that	provide	carbohydrates	such	as	yogurt	cereal	bread	cookies	etc
both	prebiotics	and	probiotics	work	together
and	it	benefits	the	body	in	terms	of	the	digestive	system	and	the	excretory	system	as	well	in	simple	terms	prebiotics	are	food	of	probiotics	therefore	eating	prebiotics	will	help	promote	better	probiotic	activity
probiotics	are	divided	into	three	main	groups	lactobacillus	it	is	the	most	common	type	of	good	bacteria	in	the	probiotic	group
it	can	be	found	in	foods	such	as	yogurt	fermented	milk	and	fermented	foods
good	for	the	digestive	system	and	good	for	those	who	have	problems	unable	to	digest	lactose	in	milk	bifidobacterium	one	of	the	best	probiotic	microorganisms
it	can	be	found	in	foods	such	as	dairy	products
contribute	to	the	relief	of	irritable	bowel	syndrome
saccharomyces	boulardii	it	is	yeast	found	in	the	probiotic	group
contribute	to	relieving	diarrhea	symptoms	and	alleviating	the	health	problems	related	to	the	digestive	system	how	important	are	probiotics	for	the	body
probiotics	play	number	of	roles	that	produce	various	health	benefits	including	what	diseases	do	probiotics	help	to	prevent	or	mitigate
why	should	we	take	probiotics
as	mentioned	above	some	foods	such	as	yogurt	and	curd	contain	beneficial	probiotics	or	microorganisms
but	few	know	that	probiotics	are	also	found	in	certain	foods	such	as	kimchi	miso	soup	kombu	tea	or	fermented	tea	pickles	and	in	some	cheeses
like	cheddar	cheese	or	mozzarella	cheese	etc
for	those	who	have	food	allergy	or	do	not	like	it	probiotic	substitute	is	recommended
they	are	available	in	many	forms	including	tablets	capsules	powders	and	other	forms
make	it	easy	to	eat	they	can	also	be	easily	purchased	at	most	pharmacies
probiotics	from	the	quality	and	standardized	supplements	are	safe	for	the	body	when	taken	in	moderation
but	in	some	people	it	can	cause	side	effects	such	as	bloating	or	belching	in	the	first	few	days
probiotics	are	known	as	endemic	microorganisms	or	normal	flora	in	the	digestive	tract
if	the	body	is	healthy	it	will	have	normal	microbial	balance
but	if	there	is	anything	that	interferes	with	the	balance	of	microorganisms	in	the	body	endemic	microorganisms	in	the	gut	are	invaded
may	have	consequences
for	example	if	the	body	has	been	taking	antibiotics	for	long	time
these	drugs	will	reduce	the	number	of	microorganisms	in	the	body
when	the	body	is	exposed	to	another	infection	disease	may	enter
and	have	chance	to	lose	good	microbes	in	the	body
therefore	it	is	important	to	establish	good	microbiological	balance	in	the	body
therefore	taking	probiotics	either	from	food	or	supplements	is	an	alternative	way	to	supplement	good	microbes	and	maintain	the	balance	of	microorganisms	in	the	body
in	addition	to	taking	care	of	your	health	by	eating	healthy	diet	and	supplementing	with	various	types	of	supplements
having	health	insurance	that	covers	the	amount	we	need
it	is	also	another	tool	that	helps	us	live	life	worry	free	in	an	age	where	medical	expenses	are	increasing	every	day

the	world	population	has	been	gradually	rising	and	will	hit	ten	billion	in	the	next	years
did	you	know	that	the	world	is	now	producing	agricultural	food	products	about	of	the	world	population	from	only	of	good	quality	soil
that	means	if	good	soil	for	planting	does	not	increase	people	will	inevitably	face	lack	of	food	problems
kazumichi	fujii	japanese	researcher	has	seriously	devoted	himself	to	study	soil	research	with	the	hope	that	he	can	develop	the	rest	of	of	soil	to	be	healthy	for	planting	and	to	solve	food	problems	for	the	world	population	in	the	future
we	will	pursue	his	study	which	aims	to	create	soil	and	sufficient	food	resources	for	human	beings
kazumichi	fujii	has	studied	soil	around	the	world	from	africa	to	the	north	of	canada
he	is	one	of	the	few	soil	researchers	who	focuses	on	fieldwork	with	an	objective	to	protect	the	world	from	food	lacking
as	good	soil	for	planting	is	rare	to	find	and	there	is	only	one	way	to	guard	the	world	against	food	crisis	that	is	to	increase	soil	quality
he	studied	why	some	soil	cant	generate	productivity	and	suggested	that	if	we	can	turn	of	the	soil	to	be	healthy	we	can	prevent	food	scarcity	in	the	future
he	studied	soil	for	years	after	graduating	from	the	university
even	though	he	doesnt	gain	much	income	from	this	type	of	work	and	he	has	to	work	alone	his	goal	has	never	changed
the	study	states	that	there	are	different	soil	types	from	over	the	world
the	soil	in	ukraine	and	north	america	is	highly	fertile	for	planting	while	the	soil	in	alaska	and	siberia	is	unhealthy
the	soil	in	southeast	asia	is	yellow	while	in	japan	is	black	and	lightweight	because	it	contains	volcanic	ash
this	shows	that	soil	varies	from	one	place	depending	on	the	inherence	of	each	region	and	different	climates
soil	is	classified	by	its	features	such	as	color	texture	mud	content	water	amount	and	mineral	components
soil	that	is	rich	for	planting	has	similar	feature	that	is	the	amount	of	mud	good	proportion	of	stones	and	sand
good	soil	also	contains	humus	an	organic	component	of	soil	such	as	dry	leaves	rotting	leaves	and	animal	muck
the	more	humus	is	in	soil	the	better	quality	of	soil	for	planting
its	found	that	black	soil	which	is	called	chernozem	or	emperor	soil	in	ukraine	and	north	america	is	the	healthiest	quality	for	planting
when	comparing	to	japanese	soil	which	is	blacker	its	not	as	healthy	as	black	soil	in	ukraine	and	north	america
soil	in	those	two	continents	is	moist	and	contains	good	minerals
however	this	type	of	soil	is	very	rare	to	find	because	those	lands	are	dry	and	the	pump	water	used	for	agriculture	comes	from	underground	so	its	much	salty
if	water	is	not	well	drained	salt	will	build	upon	the	soil	surface	that	makes	soil	salty	so	that	area	can	no	longer	plant	anything
besides	too	frequent	planting	will	cause	wind	erosion	that	means	the	wind	blows	good	soil	surface	away	and	soil	is	not	healthy	for	planting	anymore
even	though	the	previous	soil	is	in	good	condition	it	doesnt	always	remain	like	that	if	the	soil	is	used	inappropriately
the	solution	is	to	learn	from	existing	problems	and	to	prevent	the	recurrence	of	those	problems
thus	its	essential	to	provide	knowledge	for	agriculturists
kazumichi	made	survey	trip	to	north	america	and	found	that	of	good	soil	has	disappeared	in	years	but	it	takes	many	thousands	of	years	for	nature	to	create	good	soil	like	that	for	only	few	centimeters	thick
while	the	amount	of	good	quality	soil	is	gradually	reduced	the	number	of	the	world	population	is	constantly	increased
the	united	nations	predicts	that	the	world	population	will	reach	ten	billion	in	if	it	is	so	food	crisis	will	occur
thats	why	kazumichi	is	exploring	ways	to	utilize	good	soil
we	feed	billion	people	throughout	the	world	with	good	soil	out	of	all	soils	in	the	world
if	we	develop	of	the	soil	to	be	perfect	for	planting	we	can	solve	food	deficiency	problems
it	takes	many	thousands	of	years	for	stone	to	change	to	the	soil
we	cannot	only	rely	on	nature	thats	why	kazumichi	believes	that	study	solely	doesnt	bring	advantage	as	it	should	lead	to	real	practices
his	great	discovery	happened	in	indonesia	when	he	traveled	to	borneo	island	to	do	research	with	local	researchers
the	soil	in	borneo	is	rainforest	and	heavy	soil	with	high	moisture	which	doesnt	give	good	agricultural	productivity
at	first	kazumichi	thought	that	rainforest	soil	is	healthy	but	deforestation	has	left	only	centimeters	thick	of	good	soil	and	that	soil	will	be	gone	by	years	of	planting
agriculturists	then	have	to	do	their	cultivation	on	yellow	and	red	soil	which	no	plants	can	grow
thats	why	they	have	encroached	and	damaged	forest	areas	in	order	to	extend	agricultural	land	and	that	has	become	vicious	circle	which	is	not	the	right	solution
kazumichi	and	local	researchers	found	ways	to	improve	soil	quality	without	deforestation	by	studying	variety	of	local	plants	growing	around	that	area
he	found	cogon	grass	that	contains	high	potassium
if	we	burn	grass	the	ash	will	increase	potassium	to	the	soil
another	plant	is	legume	which	is	high	in	nitrogen	and	macaranga	leaf	which	is	high	in	phosphorus
this	means	that	there	is	three	food	minerals	source	for	soil	namely	potassium	nitrogen	and	phosphorus
also	the	roots	of	plants	produce	carbon	so	all	those	compositions	will	help	build	black	soil	and	other	essential	components	for	planting
innovation	has	started	by	adding	humus	and	food	minerals	into	the	soil
using	dry	and	rotting	leaves	including	grass	covering	the	ground	to	develop	soil	is	at	affordable	cost	and	theres	no	need	to	buy	chemicals	which	is	more	expensive	and	delivers	negative	effect	on	soil	in	the	long	term
kazumichi	said	that	we	must	help	farming	people	to	do	planting	up	to	years	not	just	years
if	unhealthy	soil	can	be	developed	to	bring	out	long	cultivation	it	will	build	hope	for	other	local	agriculturists	to	improve	the	soil	in	their	regions
after	kazumichi	gaining	fame	as	soil	expertise	he	has	joined	soil	development	projects	with	other	regions	over	the	world
his	observance	and	skepticism	keep	his	work	forward
although	he	hasnt	succeeded	in	developing	the	rest	of	of	soil	his	tremendous	effort	proved	that	he	has	created	good	things	for	the	world	and	it	may	light	up	tons	of	people	to	join	hands	in	making	this	world	better	place
how	do	we	use	limited	resources	to	the	utmost	benefit	and	improve	the	best	soil	quality
kazumichi	is	still	persistent	in	his	studies	every	day	to	make	ten	billion	people	live	happily	and	to	be	free	from	food	crises	in	the	future
on	his	holiday	break	from	research	he	normally	gives	lectures	about	soil	story	the	more	people	are	interested	in	soil	research	and	development	the	more	encouraging	power	will	move	on	said	kazumichi

thailand	is	entering	an	aging	society	at	leap	forward
with	approximately	million	people	entering	the	elderly	per	year
what	follows	is	the	care	of	these	elderly	people	especially	for	their	health	which	will	only	deteriorate	as	they	age
and	one	of	the	diseases	that	threaten	the	elderly	is	dementia
it	was	found	that	dementia	has	an	additional	cases	per	year	and	the	fear	is	that	percent	of	people	aged	years	and	over	suffer	from	this	disease
in	alzheimer	patients	were	found
which	is	type	of	dementia	approximately	hundred	thousand	people	with	about	new	cases	per	year

dementia	is	slow	but	permanent	loss	of	function	in	many	areas	of	the	brain
this	will	make	the	patient	have	problems	with	memory	cognition	and	decision	making	resulting	in	interfering	with	daily	life

and	not	only	helps	prevent	senile	dementia	but	also	makes	the	brain	work	more	efficiently

the	credit	card	has	become	necessary	and	is	considered	an	important	thing	in	this	cashless	society	that	customers	can	use	to	buy	things	or	services	from	the	credit	amount	allowed	from	the	bank
when	credit	card	has	been	used	the	bank	will	make	an	advance	payment	for	customers	and	the	bank	will	ask	customers	to	make	payment	back	by	issuing	the	invoice
if	customers	make	payment	punctually	in	the	full	amount	that	they	used	the	bank	will	not	include	interests	or	charges	will	not	be	included
however	if	customers	made	partial	payment	no	payment	or	failed	to	meet	the	due	date	interests	and	charges	will	be	included	and	cardholders	will	be	notified	in	the	following	invoice
with	convenience	in	using	the	credit	card	for	consumption	and	services	as	well	as	its	ability	to	provide	cash	from	any	atm	machines	according	to	the	credit	available	the	trend	of	credit	card	usage	has	become	widespread	and	become	part	of	everybodys	daily	routine	that	there	is	the	continuous	increasing	number	of	credit	card	users
as	we	all	know	that	there	are	types	of	credit	card	customers
they	are	categorized	according	to	their	debt	payment	behaviors
if	cardholders	return	the	money	in	full	amount	every	month	they	do	not	have	to	pay	interest
however	if	they	return	money	in	partial	amount	they	might	have	paid	just	the	amount	they	can	pay	or	some	will	only	pay	the	minimum
when	you	have	failed	to	meet	the	payment	due	date	the	problem	that	follows	is	the	loss	of	credibility
for	this	the	bank	will	change	your	status	from	prime	to	sub	prime	or	what	was	commonly	called	blacklist	and	the	data	will	be	reported	to	the	national	credit	bureau	resulting	in	your	bad	financial	record	and	difficulty	in	requesting	the	loan
nevertheless	the	causes	of	credit	card	debt	vary	among	individuals
credit	card	debt	in	the	legal	aspect	is	considered	as	the	guideline	for	every	debtor
even	if	you	have	yet	to	be	debtor	you	should	also	read	this	as	information	to	help	in	decision	making	whether	you	should	be	in	debt	or	not
if	you	are	sued	by	the	creditor	on	case	related	to	credit	card	which	category	does	this	case	go	under
credit	card	debt	falls	under	civil	case
the	results	of	the	civil	case	are	only	to	force	the	debtor	to	make	payment	for	the	debt	and	compensation
which	court	and	where	to	sue
for	cases	related	to	credit	card	debt	the	creditor	can	sue	the	debtor	at	court	located	within	the	premises	of	debtors	address	and	court	where	the	case	occurred	location	of	the	bank	where	the	customer	received	the	credit	card
when	does	the	prescription	start
normally	when	creditor	has	notified	the	payment	date	to	debtor	if	the	debtor	fails	to	make	payment	on	the	due	date	indicated	on	the	invoice	the	prescription	will	immediately	start	on	the	following	day	with	years	duration
if	the	bank	does	not	sue	the	debtor	within	years	the	case	will	be	precluded	resulting	in	the	bank	has	no	right	to	claim	against	the	debtor
despite	the	prescription	preclusion	the	creditor	can	sue	the	debtor	and	the	court	will	do	the	legal	process
for	example	to	reconsider	the	case	with	canceled	prescription	the	debtor	must	put	up	the	defense	that	the	prescription	has	been	precluded
the	court	will	then	reconsider	this	case	and	if	the	result	is	true	the	case	will	be	dismissed
this	means	the	case	will	end	and	not	continue	as	the	creditor	requested
according	to	the	civil	and	commercial	law	when	the	prescription	has	not	been	set	up	as	defense	the	court	cannot	dismiss	the	claim	on	the	ground	of	prescription
another	important	question	can	the	creditor	freeze	the	debtors	salaries
the	answer	is	yes
when	the	court	has	indicated	that	the	creditor	wins	over	the	case	if	the	debtor	does	not	make	payment	within	days	according	to	the	court	judgment	the	creditor	has	the	right	to	sequester	or	freeze	the	claiming	right	of	the	debtor
the	executing	officer	will	be	assigned	by	the	court	to	release	the	subpoena	of	assets	seizure
the	assets	that	can	be	seized	are	as	followed	income	income	can	be	seized	not	more	than	percent	and	the	amount	has	to	be	at	least	baht
if	there	is	another	necessary	payment	for	example	child	support	or	medical	expenses	the	debtor	can	indicate	the	evidence	to	the	legal	execution	department	for	the	reduction	of	the	percentage	assets	seizure
for	example	mr	the	debtor	has	baht	income
in	this	case	the	asset	of	mr	cannot	be	seized
mr	the	debtor	has	baht	income
in	this	case	the	asset	of	mr	can	be	seized	not	more	than	which	is	baht	with	the	remaining	amount	of	baht
bonus	this	can	be	seized	not	more	than	severance	pay	this	can	be	seized	not	more	than	three	hundred	thousand	baht	or	according	to	the	executive	officer
compensation	and	welfare	for	example	mileage	claims	accommodation	claims	utility	claims	can	be	seized	not	more	than	of	the	claims	the	debtor	received
account	balance	or	dividend	from	investment	this	can	be	seized	as	requested
as	the	creditor	has	not	indicated	the	specific	year	of	seizure	the	executive	officer	can	enforce	the	seizure	yearly	until	the	debt	has	completely	paid
asset	of	investment	for	example	stock	gold	bond	or	fund	can	be	seized	as	requested	by	indicating	the	third	party	to	make	payment	according	to	the	subpoena	of	assets	seizure	when	the	debtor	has	had	the	membership	termination
assets	that	cannot	be	frozen	salary	wage	providentfund	death	of	debtor	in	case	the	debtor	has	died	the	debt	will	not	be	precluded
when	the	debtor	has	died	the	creditor	can	claim	the	properties	of	the	debtor
the	inheritor	will	not	have	to	pay	the	debt
for	example	the	inheritor	receives	million	baht	inheritance	but	the	deceased	has	debt	up	to	million	baht	the	inheritor	just	has	to	pay	debt	up	to	the	amount	inherited	which	is	million	baht
another	million	baths	will	be	precluded
nevertheless	there	is	method	to	ease	credit	card	debt	which	is	debt	restructuring	restructuring	the	debt	is	one	of	the	methods	used	to	help	the	debtor	as	the	structure	of	the	debt	is	not	appropriate	to	the	debtors	financial	situation
there	are	various	methods	to	restructure	the	debt	such	as	debt	payment	extension	with	lower	installments	and	fixed	interest
debtors	could	try	to	ask	to	pay	only	interest	for	certain	period	of	time	and	after	that	they	can	follow	the	original	agreement	as	well	as	initiate	loan	extension	etc
thus	it	could	be	said	that	debt	restructuring	allows	the	debtor	to	pay	their	debt	without	bringing	the	matter	to	court	and	avoid	being	filed	for	bankruptcy
however	debt	restructuring	must	be	unanimously	agreed	upon	by	both	creditor	and	debtor	for	mutual	benefit
nowadays	not	only	women	want	to	look	beautiful	and	younger	men	also	visit	clinics	for	aesthetic	reasons
anti	aging	technology	used	to	beautify	individuals	has	been	developed	thus	far
with	higher	development	and	competition	its	price	has	been	reduced
thus	everyone	can	have	firming	bright	and	youthful	face	at	an	affordable	price	without	any	surgery	required	that	takes	long	time	for	recovery	and	costs	high	price
medical	innovation	that	helps	you	to	be	beautiful	or	handsome	without	having	to	concern	about	age	is	to	use	needles	injecting	the	medicines	or	substances	with	unharmful	effects	directly	to	the	facial	skin	as	well	as	other	areas
today	we	would	like	to	introduce	you	to	the	use	of	needles	for	aesthetic	treatments
how	they	can	solve	skin	problems	and	enhance	your	looks
let	us	learn	about	them	together
meso	meso	means	medium
meso	injection	is	to	inject	the	substance	into	the	middle	layer	of	the	skin
there	are	two	injection	techniques
the	old	one	mesotherapy	as	known	as	poking	meso	is	to	inject	small	amount	of	substance	into	your	top	layer	skin
its	advantage	is	that	it	will	add	collagen	to	the	skin	in	the	process
however	its	disadvantage	is	that	there	will	be	bruises	left	on	your	face
the	second	one	is	the	spot	injection
it	will	be	injected	along	with	the	flow	of	the	lymph	nodes
for	this	method	its	advantages	are	there	are	fewer	wounds	bruises	and	pain	left	on	your	skin
besides	the	effect	of	the	medicine	lasts	longer
imagine	we	bury	the	medicine	at	upstream	and	let	it	slowly	flows	and	spreads
this	technique	allows	longer	effect	than	mesotherapy
meso	injection	is	quite	safe	as	the	substance	injected	is	beneficial	to	the	skin	for	example	vitamin	improving	the	bright	skin
therefore	the	effect	left	is	only	the	marks	that	occurred	from	the	injection	which	will	disappear	within	days
types	of	meso	injection	botox	botox	also	known	as	botulinum	toxin	is	the	protein	extracted	from	bacteria	called	clostridium	botulinum
excessive	intake	of	the	bacteria	will	cause	food	poisoning	or	myasthenia	gravis
but	the	small	and	appropriate	amount	will	relax	the	muscle	which	is	beneficial	for	medical	treatment
initially	this	substance	was	used	for	treating	strabismus
then	it	had	been	developed	to	be	used	for	aesthetic	reasons
not	only	botox	can	reduce	wrinkles	and	provide	youthful	look	but	it	can	also	reduce	the	wrinkles	that	are	occurred	from	facial	expressions
filler	filler	is	hyaluronic	acid	or	ha	filling	chemical	use	to	fill	the	epidermis
under	the	epidermis	there	are	collagen	fibers	which	are	an	important	substance	to	make	the	skin	strong	and	flexible
but	when	one	gets	older	the	number	of	these	collagen	fibers	will	decrease	causing	sensitive	skin	and	wrinkles
thus	the	filler	is	developed	to	replace	the	degenerated	collagen	fibers
after	injected	with	the	filler	the	wrinkles	will	be	filled	resulting	in	youthful	look
filler	can	be	used	in	many	areas	depending	on	the	location	of	wrinkles
there	are	spots	for	the	face	which	can	provide	the	best	result	for	filler	as	followed	fine	thread	lifting	fine	thread	lifting	is	treatment	inserting	fine	thread	with	hooks	under	the	skin
after	months	the	absorbable	sutures	will	be	absorbed	without	leaving	any	danger
with	accuracy	the	fine	thread	will	turn	into	elastin	fiber	to	support	the	skin
the	lifting	spots	are	at	the	lower	cheeks	and	mastoid	pulled	together
cheeks	will	be	lifted	resulting	in	untightened	skin	reduction
the	hooks	will	hold	the	skin	up	along	the	direction	of	the	thread
fine	thread	lifting	is	the	facial	shape	adjustment	or	lifting	technique	that	is	popular	at	the	moment
for	this	treatment	the	needle	is	used	for	sewing	the	thread	into	the	face
the	needle	used	varies	in	size	to	prevent	swelling	or	edema
the	effect	in	the	elderly	will	be	shorter	because	of	the	lack	of	elastin	but	with	multiple	treatments	the	result	will	be	better	because	fine	thread	lifting	will	help	with	elastin	generation
even	the	thread	has	dissolved	if	the	tissues	build	up	lot	of	elastin	the	firmness	will	stay
although	there	are	numerous	anti	aging	techniques	or	beauty	innovations	available	in	the	market	technology	called	fine	thread	lifting	is	the	most	popular	as	it	can	provide	rapid	result	safety	if	the	treatment	has	been	done	by	the	professional	doctor	with	quality	product	it	does	not	require	any	recovery	and	has	affordable	price	started	from	thousands	to	ten	thousands	baht
even	physique	does	not	last	forever	but	new	technology	can	maintain	and	prolong	youthful	looks	as	well	as	enhancing	personalities	and	confidence
someone	has	said	for	beauty	the	earlier	you	invest	for	beauty	the	worthier	it	will	get
thus	do	not	waste	your	time	waiting
learn	about	the	information	of	the	certified	clinic	with	professional	and	highly	experienced	doctors	and	use	an	scb	credit	card
do	not	forgetmerit	can	make	you	beautiful	in	the	next	life	face	treatment	can	make	you	beautiful	now
let	scb	make	you	beautiful

when	you	want	to	find	out	how	your	health	is	doing	you	do	an	annual	checkup	and	if	the	results	show	that	you	are	at	risk	of	developing	disease	you	quickly	respond	by	getting	treatment	or	cure
similarly	if	you	want	to	know	how	your	financial	health	is	doing	you	will	need	to	know	how	to	analyze	your	personal	financial	statements
when	faced	with	the	term	personal	financial	statements	many	people	may	feel	that	it	has	something	to	do	with	accounting	and	therefore	found	it	hard	to	understand
but	in	reality	it	is	something	that	is	closer	to	home	than	you	think	and	with	it	you	are	able	to	quickly	evaluate	the	condition	of	your	financial	health
personal	financial	statement	is	document	or	spreadsheet	which	summarises	an	individuals	financial	position	at	given	point	in	time	which	shows	how	many	assets	and	liabilities	an	individual	has
to	figure	your	personal	financial	statement	take	your	generated	income	assets	expenses	liabilities	in	each	period
monthly	quarterly	yearly
after	adding	and	subtracting	these	variables	you	will	be	able	to	figure	out	your	financial	status	known	as	net	wealth
therefore	personal	financial	statement	consists	of	parts	which	are	assets	and	liabilities
assets	refer	to	money	or	anything	that	has	monetary	value
liabilities	refer	to	loans	and	debts	created	that	must	be	repaid
notice	that	when	referring	to	assets	most	people	have	good	understanding	of	what	assets	are
liabilities	on	the	other	hand	may	cause	confusion	and	among	people
for	example	some	people	tend	to	forget	to	calculate	the	interest	rate	into	the	principal	that	they	have	to	pay	or	some	people	agree	to	be	guarantor	without	realizing	that	being	guarantor	is	another	type	of	debt
more	importantly	some	people	do	not	categorize	their	types	of	debt	into	short	term	debts	and	long	term	debts	resulting	in	mistakes	being	made	in	their	debt	management
if	you	end	up	taking	out	loan	and	using	it	to	benefit	your	quality	of	life	and	the	level	of	debt	created	is	at	an	appropriate	level	then	it	enables	you	to	manage	the	repayment	of	that	debt
but	if	you	end	up	taking	large	loan	that	is	beyond	what	is	necessary	and	incur	too	much	debt	that	you	are	unable	to	pay	it	off	negative	consequences	will	follow
therefore	control	the	amount	of	debt	created	so	that	it	is	at	an	appropriate	and	manageable	level	which	can	be	seen	from	the	financial	ratio	as	follows	debt	service	ratio	is	measurement	of	your	ability	to	pay	off	all	your	liabilities	with	the	general	benchmark	for	the	value	being	lower	than	and	no	higher	than	of	your	total	monthly	income
non	mortgage	service	ratio	is	measurement	of	your	ability	to	pay	off	debts	resulting	from	consumption	excluding	debt	created	from	housing
credit	card	debt	car	payments	etc
this	should	not	be	less	than	and	not	higher	than	of	your	total	monthly	income
example	if	mr	has	salary	of	baht	this	means	that	his	ability	to	pay	off	his	debt	debt	service	ratio	should	not	exceed	baht	per	month	and	his	ability	to	pay	for	debts	resulting	from	consumption	non	mortgage	service	ratio	should	not	exceed	baht	per	month
from	the	previous	example	after	mr	has	created	consumption	debt	non	mortgage	service	ratio	of	baht	he	will	end	up	creating	other	debt	like	debt	from	housing	and	accommodation	which	should	not	exceed	baht
therefore	no	matter	what	kind	of	reason	before	making	decision	to	go	into	debt	try	stopping	and	asking	yourself	these	following	questions	if	your	answers	to	these	questions	are	all	then	there	is	enough	reason	for	you	to	go	into	debt	and	it	should	not	cause	you	financial	problems	in	the	future
however	if	the	answer	to	these	questions	is	mixture	of	both	and	your	decision	to	go	into	debt	may	end	up	causing	financial	problems	in	the	future
therefore	you	should	delay	your	decision	before	creating	more	debt
creating	debt	is	neither	something	scary	nor	should	it	be	considered	as	mistakes	in	life
however	one	should	know	how	to	control	all	their	liabilities	and	debts	so	that	they	are	at	an	appropriate	and	manageable	level	allowing	you	to	have	the	ability	to	pay	the	debts	back
you	can	find	out	your	ability	and	the	level	of	debt	you	can	incur	through	the	analysis	of	your	liabilities	through	your	personal	financial	statements
this	will	allow	you	to	recognize	the	different	types	of	debt	and	after	studying	carefully	and	understanding	your	debts	it	will	allow	for	effective	debt	management	resulting	in	no	negative	consequences	generated	from	debt	in	your	quality	of	life
when	pandemic	covid	has	spread	all	over	the	world	despite	taking	great	care	of	physical	health	financial	health	does	not	seem	to	be	able	to	escape	from	it
it	is	the	moment	of	anxiety	that	every	morning	when	people	wake	up	they	will	worry	whether	they	can	sell	anything	today	or	whether	the	job	they	are	having	is	still	stable	one
thus	let	us	decrease	our	anxiety	warm	our	hearts	with	saving	and	reduce	expenses	as	much	as	we	can
change	the	mindset	or	thinking	process
we	should	be	ready	and	accept	that	the	effects	of	covid	will	remain	long	term	on	our	planet	earth	without	an	appointment	to	leave
the	most	important	thing	is	to	tell	ourselves	that	we	have	to	survive
when	we	are	determined	to	be	survivor	we	just	have	to	remember	the	magic	spell
it	goes	like	this	from	now	on	lets	spend	wisely	on	the	necessaries	embrace	cash	as	much	as	possible	and	if	theres	an	opportunity	for	more	income	forward	we	go	set	daily	expenses	with	the	help	of	an	application
we	should	set	our	goal	on	how	much	we	will	spend	per	day	and	record	incomes	and	expenses	with	mobile	application	that	will	immediately	show	our	lifestyle	from	spending
it	will	alarm	us	that	we	have	exceeded	our	spending	goal
there	are	many	applications	for	us	to	download	free	of	charge
for	example	money	lover	money	manager	expense	budget	oh	my	cost	or	metang	etc
save	what	can	be	saved
in	every	expense	if	we	can	get	someone	to	share	the	burden	we	will	spend	much	lesser	than	solely	spend	all	by	ourselves
we	can	try	searching	for	people	to	share	those	expenses	through	the	application	called	partyhaan	an	application	that	was	launched	especially	for	this	purpose
more	importantly	we	should	not	create	more	debt
we	should	clear	our	current	debt	first	as	we	can	never	know	how	grim	the	economy	can	be
do	not	belittle	low	income
we	have	to	save	all	those	small	incomes	that	can	change	into	the	emergency	funds	in	the	future
every	day	when	we	reached	home	just	try	to	save	small	notes	or	coins	in	the	piggy	bank
it	is	an	indirect	method	of	saving	that	could	give	an	incredible	result
put	reasons	before	emotions
before	any	decision	in	buying	try	to	take	some	time	and	count	we	should	use	reasons	to	make	decisions	more	than	to	use	the	emotion	of	wanting	as	an	answer
we	should	reconfirm	with	ourselves	whether	the	product	is	necessary	for	our	life	and	not	just	buy	because	the	product	is	on	promotion	or	cheap
diy	stands	for	do	it	yourself
we	have	now	entered	the	era	of	saving	that	whatever	can	be	fixed	let	us	try	to	fix	it	first
also	do	not	just	decide	to	throw	old	and	shabby	goods	away
we	should	try	to	diy	them	first	and	we	might	even	make	something	new	out	of	them	with	our	pride	in	making	it
for	example	some	furniture	will	often	be	used	during	the	work	from	home	period
if	we	do	makeover	even	the	smallest	change	can	create	refreshing	vibes	without	having	to	spend	money	on	new	furniture
eat	what	we	grow	and	grow	what	we	eat
during	the	lockdown	period	that	required	every	individual	to	stay	at	home	one	of	the	activities	that	many	people	have	tried	must	be	growing	vegetables
this	activity	must	have	become	many	peoples	cup	of	tea	because	we	get	to	eat	vegetables	that	is	free	of	chemical	and	good	for	our	family	and	our	health
also	it	can	definitely	reduce	expenses	especially	for	big	families
turn	hobby	into	job
this	never	gets	old	as	long	as	having	one	job	is	risk	because	nobody	can	guarantee	that	the	sole	job	they	are	doing	is	so	stable	like	mountain	that	cannot	be	moved
it	is	now	time	for	us	to	turn	our	hobby	into	our	strength	or	develop	it	into	another	job	to	seek	more	income
apparently	during	the	outbreak	of	the	pandemic	many	people	have	shown	their	strengths	on	many	platforms	for	more	income	such	as	cooking	baking	hand	made	products	photography	etc
if	we	can	follow	every	point	that	was	mentioned	above	no	matter	how	many	more	crisis	we	will	face	we	can	be	sure	that	our	purse	will	still	be	packed
the	important	thing	to	remember	is	how	sincere	and	discipline	we	are	to	seriously	do	this
without	further	ado	let	us	get	started
easy	to	start	saving
equal	every	month	get	full	interest	tax	free
before	deciding	to	borrow	or	go	into	debt	one	should	always	ask	themselves	whether	they	are	ready
there	are	many	cases	in	which	taking	out	loan	without	taking	the	necessary	precautions	and	preparations	results	in	many	problems	that	follow
for	example	not	being	able	to	find	the	required	funds	to	pay	off	that	loan	when	it	is	due
therefore	if	taking	out	loan	results	in	problems	and	issues	in	your	cash	flow	then	the	decision	to	take	out	loan	should	be	delayed
since	the	basic	rules	of	borrowing	state	that	once	you	are	in	debt	that	debt	must	be	repaid	in	full
it	cannot	be	denied	that	most	if	not	all	creditors	prefer	debtors	who	pay	off	their	loans	in	full	and	on	time
creditors	in	turn	often	repay	the	favor	with	various	benefits	for	the	debtor
for	example	the	next	time	the	debtor	needs	to	take	out	loan	the	creditor	may	take	less	time	in	their	considerations	and	make	it	more	convenient	and	easy	for	the	loan	to	be	approved	or	they	can	provide	the	debtor	with	special	benefits	like	lower	interest	rate	for	the	loan	altogether
being	good	and	prudent	debtor	can	be	done	by	doing	the	following	have	system	to	document	and	keep	record	of	all	evidence	regarding	the	loan
the	first	thing	that	you	need	to	do	after	taking	out	loan	is	to	keep	careful	records	of	the	documents	involved	in	the	loan	as	evidence	since	it	is	important	information
in	the	case	that	changes	are	made	in	the	agreement	adjustments	made	to	the	loan	contract	or	lawsuit	should	occur	the	document	kept	can	be	used	as	evidence	to	protect	your	interests	and	prevent	either	side	to	have	an	advantage	over	the	other	concerning	the	loan
dont	forget	to	record	and	keep	track	of	everything
good	and	prudent	debtor	knows	the	amount	and	the	type	of	each	debt	they	are	responsible	for
this	is	possible	through	the	process	of	recording	and	noting	everything	such	as	credit	card	debt	car	payments	mortgage	payments	etc
it	is	important	to	categorize	the	different	types	of	debts	into	what	is	considered	too	good	debt	and	bad	debt
after	that	note	the	interest	rates	for	each	debt	when	the	payment	for	the	debt	needs	to	be	completed	and	how	many	more	installments	are	left	to	be	paid
consistently	recording	and	noting	down	everything	helps	you	keep	track	of	how	much	debt	you	have	left	to	be	paid	which	provides	insights	on	your	financial	capabilities
always	have	backup	plan
no	one	is	capable	of	predicting	what	will	happen	in	the	future
sudden	reduction	in	your	salary	losing	your	job	and	becoming	unemployed	etc
if	an	unexpected	event	was	to	occur	it	could	result	in	causing	your	usual	source	of	income	to	disappear	completely
but	the	responsibility	of	paying	off	the	debt	that	you	have	created	still	remains	resulting	in	you	being	unable	to	make	ends	meet
to	prepare	and	prevent	this	you	should	always	have	backup	plan
your	back	up	plan	can	consist	of	saving	money	each	month	into	for	emergencies	only	account	which	accumulates	to	sum	of	money	that	is	times	more	than	the	amount	of	your	regular	monthly	spending
for	example	if	your	monthly	spending	is	baht	per	month	the	money	that	you	have	in	your	for	emergencies	only	account	should	be	around	baht	baht
if	you	face	the	misfortune	of	suddenly	becoming	unemployed	the	debt	and	payments	that	you	are	responsible	for	can	be	taken	from	the	for	emergencies	only	account	and	reimbursed	later
if	you	have	questions	and	concerns	make	sure	you	ask	the	appropriate	financial	officers	involved
when	using	financial	services	from	financial	institutions	one	of	the	important	rights	that	debtor	has	is	receiving	correct	and	accurate	information
financial	institution	officers	and	employees	must	be	able	to	provide	the	necessary	information	terms	and	conditions	and	details	concerning	the	financial	product	package	or	service	that	they	are	providing
there	must	not	be	any	distortion	of	facts	and	the	information	provided	must	be	complete	and	accurate	so	that	the	customer	may	have	sufficient	information	to	make	decision
examples	of	the	information	provided	include	benefits	received	risks	involving	the	use	of	the	product	package	or	service	costs	service	charges	and	fines	to	pay	if	you	do	not	follow	the	terms	and	conditions
one	should	also	be	aware	of	the	marketing	materials	used	to	generate	sales	be	wary	that	they	are	not	too	exaggerated	resulting	in	confusion	for	the	customers
therefore	if	debtor	does	not	understand	or	has	questions	regarding	the	information	provided	they	should	ask	immediately
if	you	experience	or	feel	that	the	officer	or	employee	of	the	financial	institution	is	conducting	themselves	inappropriately	or	if	customer	feels	like	they	were	taken	advantage	of	or	exploited
they	are	provided	with	inaccurate	and	incomplete	information	the	financial	officer	or	employee	was	rude	the	interest	rate	was	calculated	incorrectly	you	feel	you	are	being	pushed	to	buy	certain	financial	product	or	service	you	are	able	to	file	complaint	to	the	customer	service	department	of	that	financial	institution	so	that	the	problem	can	be	solved	promptly
dont	try	to	escape	from	your	debt
when	you	feel	that	you	are	unable	to	pay	the	debt	that	you	have	created	in	time	for	when	it	is	due	do	not	escape	from	your	debt	you	must	contact	the	financial	officer	or	creditor	involved	right	way	to	figure	out	solution
not	only	does	this	show	your	good	intentions	and	sincerity	as	debtor	it	bolsters	the	trust	that	the	creditor	has	in	you	and	more	importantly	it	will	not	damage	your	credit	rating
being	good	and	prudent	debtor	not	only	removes	lot	of	the	unhappiness	associated	with	taking	out	loan	but	it	also	reduces	risks	protects	you	from	the	dangers	that	may	arise	from	using	the	services	of	financial	institutions	and	it	allows	you	to	receive	the	proper	service	from	the	financial	institutions	as	well
nobody	would	want	to	be	in	debt	but	sometimes	it	is	necessary	to	take	on	loan	to	enhance	liquidity	or	solve	some	problems
this	means	if	you	are	disciplined	and	see	the	value	of	money	you	will	be	able	to	pay	your	debt	in	time	and	debt	is	not	bad	thing
but	if	you	are	spendthrift	that	has	tendency	to	create	more	debt	you	might	not	be	able	to	pay	off	your	debt
the	more	your	debt	is	the	longer	it	takes	to	clear	them
lacking	financial	discipline	is	an	important	factor	that	can	lead	to	debts
debtors	are	usually	people	who	are	not	careful	when	spending
they	have	lifestyle	of	spendthrift	and	prioritizes	their	social	status
also	they	lack	the	ability	to	estimate	their	own	buying	power
is	it	possible	to	be	safe	spender	before	spendthrift	by	creating	debt	in	the	appropriate	amount
to	control	the	debt	ceiling	in	the	appropriate	amount	by	considering	how	much	debt	can	be	owed	and	the	amount	should	not	exceed	the	annual	income	and	how	much	of	the	installment	should	not	exceed	the	monthly	income
this	debt	ceiling	control	rule	is	called	rule
do	not	loan	more	than	of	annual	net	income	example	this	means	debt	should	not	exceed	baht	per	year
majority	of	this	type	of	debt	is	usually	debt	created	for	consumption	or	convenience	such	as	credit	card	shopping	mobile	phone	memberships	car	loan	etc
this	debt	thus	does	not	include	housing	loan	or	education	loan
do	not	pay	installment	more	than	of	monthly	net	income	example	this	means	debt	installment	should	not	exceed	baht	per	month
this	type	of	debt	is	usually	created	for	consumption	or	convenience	and	does	not	include	housing	loans	or	education	loans
to	effectively	control	the	debt	ceiling	you	need	to	classify	the	types	of	debt	well
the	types	of	debt	are	debt	that	will	bring	about	profit	in	the	future	and	debt	that	will	not	create	any	benefit	such	as	debt	created	for	consumption	and	convenience
when	you	know	about	this	type	of	debt	you	will	then	be	more	careful	about	spending
to	effectively	control	the	debt	ceiling	you	need	to	classify	the	types	of	debt	well
the	types	of	debt	are	debt	that	will	bring	about	profit	in	the	future	and	debt	that	will	not	create	any	benefit	such	as	debt	created	for	consumption	and	convenience
when	you	know	about	this	type	of	debt	you	will	then	be	more	careful	about	spending
the	kind	of	debt	that	should	be	created	is	the	debt	that	will	bring	about	future	profit
debt	for	housing	debt	for	housing	is	the	debt	that	will	create	long	term	stability	for	you	and	your	family
once	you	pay	off	all	the	debt	the	house	becomes	your	property
debt	for	education	debt	for	education	is	the	debt	to	build	the	future
when	you	are	educated	you	are	more	likely	to	see	the	opportunity	to	earn	more	or	improve	whatever	you	own
debt	for	business	debt	for	business	is	the	debt	that	will	bring	about	future	income	such	as	taking	loan	to	buy	machinery	for	business
after	knowing	what	kind	of	debt	should	be	created	you	have	to	know	how	to	manage	them	effectively	as	well
appropriate	debt	amount	this	means	you	should	know	the	amount	you	earn	and	should	know	the	appropriate	amount	that	you	can	be	in	debt	that	it	will	not	bring	you	and	people	around	your	troubles
do	not	run	when	it	is	time	to	pay	the	debt	you	should	pay	punctually	in	the	amount	that	you	should	pay
if	you	can	follow	this	you	will	have	good	record	and	next	time	if	you	need	to	take	loan	it	will	not	be	hard	for	you	to	get	approved
regularly	check	when	you	are	in	debt	you	should	regularly	check	on	your	debt	to	always	be	aware	of	how	much	you	still	owe
you	can	record	down	the	creditors	the	amount	you	owe	interest	rate	outstanding	amount	due	date	as	well	as	other	conditions
classify	debts	you	have	to	classify	if	the	debt	you	owe	is	good	or	bad	one
then	you	should	owe	less	of	the	bad	debts	and	when	you	are	clear	of	all	debts	you	should	not	create	any	more	debts
nowadays	being	in	debt	can	happen	easily
therefore	if	you	change	your	spending	behavior	and	classify	your	debt	control	your	debt	ceiling	well	as	well	as	manage	your	debt	you	and	people	around	you	will	not	be	troubled	by	your	debt
over	the	past	three	to	four	years	we	have	heard	the	word	innovation	often	as	it	means	in	terms	of	technology
but	from	the	author	own	the	notion	of	innovation	and	its	impact	on	thailands	economic	policy	case	study	of	japanese	mangainnovation	can	only	have	broader	meaning	than	technological	innovation
because	innovation	means	the	invention	of	new	things	that	can	create	value	in	the	business	or	in	the	economy
the	following	articles	will	be	discussed
japanese	cultural	innovation	selected	all	issues	which	create	both	business	value
and	valuable	in	the	society	and	culture	by	today	will	talk	about	japanese	idol	business	originally	entertainment	businesses	such	as	japanese	dramas	movies	or	music	artists	are	rather	self	sufficient
because	the	artists	themselves	are	considered	product	of	the	company
the	artist	does	not	have	the	right	to	take	pictures	and	play	with	anyone	as	he	wants
because	it	is	considered	the	unauthorized	use	of	the	company	products
japanese	artists	are	therefore	more	difficult	to	reach	than	thai	artists	who	come	across	them	by	accident	they	can	greet	talk	or	ask	for	permission	to	take	photos	with	respect	at	any	given	time
is	not	secretly	filming	but	asked	for	permission	to	take	pictures	and	get	consent	from	the	artist	the	main	products	of	the	entertainment	business	are	selling	music	drama	sales	movie	sales
but	when	times	change	the	entertainment	industry	was	increasingly	disrupted	and	consumers	eventually	no	longer	bought	cds	to	listen	to	music	or	dvds	to	watch	dramas	or	movies
the	birth	of	new	japanese	idol	business	akb	can	therefore	be	considered	form	of	cultural	innovation
akb	has	its	own	disruption	on	many	issues
first	japanese	artists	are	generally	hard	to	reach
there	is	very	little	chance	that	fans	will	meet	in	person	but	akb	has	created	new	group	idols	you	can	access	often	such	as	handshake	events	autograph	work	couple	photoshoots	etc	depending	on	the	purchasing	power	of	the	fans
the	next	issue	the	creation	of	new	idol	group	like	akb	the	concept	of	shojo	manga	manga	for	teenage	girls	was	used	in	the	development	of	the	band
if	it	is	shonen	manga	manga	for	young	men	it	must	have	characteristics	it	shows	the	friendship	the	perseverance	of	the	character	and	the	victory	gained	through	that	perseverance
therefore	doing	an	idol	group	will	not	emphasize	the	perfection	of	an	idol
but	will	focus	on	imperfection
because	they	want	the	fans	to	have	love	in	the	younger	ones	and	to	pay	attention	to	the	imperfections
helping	the	idols	through	any	obstacles	or	conflicts	in	life	for	their	future	growth
therefore	the	idol	business	does	not	focus	on	the	perfect	looking	person	does	not	focus	on	selling	cds	or	selling	music	not	selling	dvds	or	selling	dramas	and	movies	but	selling	good	experiences	that	fans	get	from	pampering	the	idols	who	are	not	perfect
therefore	the	idol	business	must	have	many	members
which	are	the	characteristics	of	both	shonen	and	shojo
that	there	must	be	many	protagonists	with	different	characters	for	the	fans	to	like
idols	emphasize	group	culture
teamwork	despite	having	different	characters	there	are	some	conflicts	in	the	band
but	there	must	be	oneness	as	member	of	the	same	group
the	idol	business	is	new	cultural	innovation	that	generates	huge	income
because	it	does	not	adhere	to	the	model	that	must	sell	what	is	the	product	but	took	the	feelings	and	experiences	of	the	fans	as	product	instead
is	new	product	development
it	can	be	song	drama	movie	an	event	etc
discover	new	markets	that	were	originally	saturated
and	able	to	create	new	business	models	in	the	traditional	entertainment	business	platform
leading	to	the	creation	of	many	other	idol	groups	both	in	japan	and	in	thailand	such	as	bnk	sweat	fever	sy	siam	dream	etc
we	must	keep	an	eye	on	how	long	the	life	cycle	of	japanese	idol	groups	is	in	thailand	for	cultural	innovation
article	by	wirayut	pojsathienkul	human	resource	development	specialist	in	international	business	organization	lecturers	alumni	association	of	japan	under	the	royal	patronage	interpreters	and	lecturers	of	many	institutions	good	exchange	rate	anywhere	anytime	through	scb	easy	app
in	the	past	many	of	us	might	not	even	have	an	idea	that	human	beings	will	be	able	to	talk	face	to	face	in	long	distance	communication	or	our	health	can	be	reported	in	detail	through	wristwatch
similarly	nowadays	you	can	never	be	certain	if	the	end	of	the	line	answering	your	calls	or	messages	is	human	or	not
especially	in	the	past	years	artificial	intelligence	ai	started	to	be	widely	talked	about	and	it	has	become	closer	to	people	day	by	day	closer	than	we	think
this	is	because	ai	has	numerous	abilities
it	acts	as	data	processing	system	within	the	organization	voice	recognition	system	auto	reply	messages	all	the	way	to	google	search	or	facebook	advertisements
these	are	the	work	of	ai
ai	is	modeled	to	imitate	the	behavior	of	humans
at	the	same	time	it	does	certain	activities	better	than	humans	do
nowadays	ai	is	categorized	in	to	groups	according	to	its	ability	namely	narrow	ai	is	expertise	in	certain	fields	with	an	ability	superior	to	human	being
for	example	ai	assisted	robotic	surgery
general	ai	is	an	ai	with	the	same	level	of	ability	as	human	beings
it	touches	objects	and	communicates	with	human	language
it	detects	patterns	of	the	situation	and	adapts	to	the	changing	environment	with	similar	efficacy	as	humans
strong	ai	is	an	ai	with	an	ability	that	is	superior	to	human	beings	in	many	ways
it	learns	human	emotions	plans	and	solves	problems
it	can	easily	complete	these	tasks	better	and	more	effectively	than	humans
however	in	the	present	strong	ai	is	not	widely	spotted
as	for	the	business	section	international	data	corporation	idc	in	the	united	states	of	america	reveals	that	of	worldwide	business	in	several	manufacturing	has	started	plan	to	bring	ai	technology	to	develop	their	business	in	the	next	years	from	now	and	estimates	the	cost	worldwide	in	as	for	the	purchase	of	ai	the	cost	will	be	around	ten	billion	us	dollars	or	increased	three	folds	compared	to	that	of	the	popular	systems	that	are	mostly	used	in	the	business	section	are	database	learning	and	big	data	processing	natural	language	processing	nlp	and	virtual	assistant	service
an	example	would	be	the	world	renowned	brand	that	is	successful	in	adapting	ai	systems	into	their	business	like	amazon	echo	from	amazon
it	is	device	that	clearly	reaches	human	beings	from	the	voice	command	system	through	electronic	devices	within	houses
it	also	includes	answering	general	questions	searching	information	online	purchasing	goods	forecasting	weather	as	well	as	learning	users	behavior
another	example	is	from	worlds	class	brand	originated	in	china	like	alibaba
it	solves	the	domestic	problem	of	excessive	trash	due	to	large	number	of	citizens	within	the	country	through	the	alipay	application	the	mobile	banking	service
by	taking	ai	technology	and	virtual	reality	vr	technology	to	create	garbage	sorting	program	it	can	automatically	identify	the	types	of	trash	just	by	scanning	through	mobile	phone
back	to	thailand	siam	commercial	bank	or	scb	is	one	the	first	business	that	adapts	ai	technology	to	digital	lending	in	which	mae	manee	digital	lending	is	able	to	approve	lending	within	minutes	at	the	interest	rate	of	monthly	or	yearly
it	is	developed	with	ai	technology	and	machine	learning	by	using	behavior	to	analyze	and	decide	the	approval	of	lending	to	match	the	needs	of	each	customer	in	both	the	financial	amount	and	appropriate	loan	term	as	well	as	studies	from	the	behavior	of	entrepreneurs	who	are	the	target	from	platforms	like	lazada	and	amazon
many	people	believe	that	ai	will	not	stop	in	the	future
it	will	be	constantly	developing	and	will	establish	convenience	for	human	being	so	much	so	that	we	cannot	imagine
like	in	the	pastthings	that	we	could	not	fathom	really	happen	in	the	present
references	professional	and	comprehensive	business	management	solutions
recently	we	hear	the	word	innovation	often	referring	to	technology
but	from	the	author	own	the	notion	of	innovation	and	its	impact	on	thailands	economic	policy	case	study	of	japanese	mangainnovation	can	only	have	broader	meaning	than	technological	innovation
because	innovation	means	the	invention	of	new	things	that	can	create	value	in	the	business	or	in	the	economy
the	following	articles	will	be	discussed
japanese	cultural	innovation	selected	all	issues	which	create	both	business	value
and	valuable	in	the	society	and	culture	by	today	will	talk	about	business	tourism	in	japan	no	one	would	deny	that	japan	is	one	of	the	most	popular	countries	for	tourists	around	the	world
including	thai	tourists
especially	in	the	latter	period	japan	allows	thais	to	be	able	to	travel	with	day	visa	free	causing	many	thai	people	to	travel	to	japan	every	year
the	making	of	the	tourism	business	is	one	of	japan	cultural	innovations
it	is	therefore	interesting	to	study	as	an	example	of	the	tourism	business	of	thailand
the	first	method	that	japan	uses	to	develop	its	own	tourism	business	is	creating	an	identity	of	the	attraction
in	addition	to	having	habit	of	keeping	their	own	traditions	both	tangible	and	intangible
the	japanese	also	know	how	to	develop	the	identity	of	their	attractions	to	be	unique	and	different	from	other	tourist	spots
is	that	each	tourist	attraction	is	unique	supporting	stories	and	publicity	have	been	created	as	memorable	image	for	foreign	tourists
for	example	if	it	is	hokkaido	tourists	will	know	immediately	that	winter	snow	in	summer	there	is	lavender	field
if	it	is	okinawa	prefecture	you	must	visit	in	summer	because	the	sea	is	beautiful
kyoto	prefecture	you	must	visit	many	old	japanese	temples	and	beautiful	ancient	sites
in	which	the	creation	of	this	identity	each	attraction	will	try	to	be	unique
in	order	not	to	create	me	too	marketing	condition	who	is	there
what	do	need
but	japan	will	try	to	make	each	tourist	destination	different
until	it	is	worth	going	to	all	places	because	they	are	not	unique	do	not	compete	with	customers
another	technique	is	to	use	the	mascot	it	will	be	noted	that	japan	is	country	of	the	manga
as	already	written	about	japanese	cartoons	and	animation	therefore	many	mascots	are	used	and	designed	to	be	the	mascot	of	each	tourist	attraction	as	an	ambassador	for	tourism	and	as	souvenir	product	in	various	forms	as	well
there	is	also	matter	of	effective	communication	which	is	every	major	train	station	that	is	tourist	destination
there	will	be	tourist	assistance	center	with	both	train	maps	and	advisory	services	on	travel	planning	effectively
the	staff	at	these	help	centers	speak	several	languages	which	helps	the	tourists	not	feel	lost	in	japan
in	addition	some	tourist	attractions	are	classified	as	course	as	well	as	how	you	like	to	walk
for	example	course	will	have	lot	of	flowers	to	view	while	course	will	pass	the	old	buildings	bit	while	course	will	have	sweet	atmosphere	for	date
that	is	in	many	of	the	same	tourist	spots	walking	courses	are	divided	in	this	way	according	to	the	japanese	travel	books
make	it	easy	to	understand	easy	to	walk	around	rarely	lost
so	tourists	can	travel	with	peace	of	mind
and	japan	also	rarely	has	gangs	deceiving	foreign	tourists	as	well
due	to	strict	laws	cannot	make	living	by	deceiving	tourists
technology	is	another	thing	that	japan	uses	to	help	develop	tourism	businesses
some	popular	tourist	attractions	including	the	airport	qr	translator	is	also	used	to	serve	tourists
even	if	can	read	japanese	just	scan	the	data	will	be	translated	in	your	own	language
read	and	understand	without	worry
you	can	scan	the	way	of	worshiping	sacred	things	according	to	tourist	sites	scan	the	history	of	that	place	or	scan	the	map	of	that	attraction	etc
in	many	formats
while	not	all	places	have	this	qr	system	it	will	certainly	become	more	widespread	in	the	future
these	are	the	cultural	innovations	that	japan	has	adopted	in	the	development	of	its	own	tourism	business
to	become	famous	tourist	destination	that	tourists	from	all	over	the	world	want	to	visit
article	by	wirayut	pojsathienkul	human	resource	development	specialist	in	international	business	organization	lecturers	alumni	association	of	japan	under	the	royal	patronage	interpreters	and	lecturers	of	many	institutions	good	exchange	rate	anywhere	anytime	through	scb	easy	app
quick	cash	easy	loan	no	credit	bureau	checking	no	documents	need	call	xxxxxxxx
this	is	another	easy	cash	loan	and	easy	death
bad	economy	and	no	cash	tricks	many	people	from	stepping	into	this	informal	debt
although	they	know	how	scary	it	is	they	still	fall	into	this	trap
it	makes	them	broke	and	their	families	and	their	surrounding	people
data	from	the	legal	aid	center	for	debtors	and	victims	of	injustice	department	of	special	investigation	shows	that	there	are	many	complaints	regarding	informal	debt
complaints	via	tel
to	the	office	of	the	prime	minister	are	cases	with	the	highest	number	from	the	center	part	cases	and	cases	are	from	bangkok
cases	from	the	northeastern	part	cases	from	the	north	cases	from	the	southern	part	cases	from	the	east	and	cases	from	the	unknown
let	talk	about	the	scary	story	of	informal	debt	so	that	you	will	not	be	fooled	into	seeing	that	it	easy	to	get	money	because	in	the	end	you	might	become	slave	and	fear	brutal	debt	collection
high	interest	rate	think	about	what	is	said	that	an	interest	rate	was	only	per	month	the	daily	debt	seemed	to	be	able	to	pay	off
few	hundred	baht	per	day	but	think	carefully
the	interest	is	per	year	overtaking	the	principal	times
such	high	interest	and	the	debt	cannot	be	paid	off
many	people	have	to	go	to	borrow	money	more	to	pay	only	interest
slave	for	lifetime
let	compare	the	interest	of	the	debt	in	the	system	and	the	debt	of	the	informal	system	assuming	loan	of	baht
debt	in	system	with	an	interest	rate	of	per	month	and	months	pay	off
the	overall	payment	is	including	baht	of	interest
debt	in	the	informal	system	with	an	interest	rate	of	per	month	and	months	pay	off
the	overall	payment	is	including	baht	of	interest
floating	interest	floating	interest	cases	can	occur	if	the	debtor	is	unable	to	pay	the	full	amount	at	the	same	time	and	only	interest	can	be	paid
as	result	the	total	amount	of	money	to	be	paid	will	be	compounded	into	both	the	capital	and	the	interest	until	the	debt	balance	rises
the	financial	burden	will	be	increased	and	when	added	to	the	former	then	the	result	will	be	from	few	thousand	baht	loans	that	may	float	to	tens	of	thousands	or	hundreds	of	thousands	when	the	debtor	is	unable	to	repay	the	debt
no	clearly	contract	detail	informal	loan	contracts	are	not	verifiable	and	rarely	have	clear	timeline
so	the	borrower	cannot	negotiate	with	creditors	as	well	and	the	borrower	will	not	be	protected	by	law
while	the	loan	in	the	system	although	it	takes	more	documents	and	procedures	which	at	present	the	loan	process	in	the	system	is	much	easier	and	faster	is	more	reliable	and	can	build	confidence	in	repayment	to	the	borrower
may	be	involved	in	illegal	activities	there	is	no	way	of	knowing	where	the	people	who	lend	us	money	get	money	come	from	for	loan	outside	the	system
it	may	come	from	doing	various	illegal	businesses	which	if	involved	in	these	illegal	things	it	may	be	difficult	for	the	police	or	government	officials	to	help	the	debtor	in	timely	manner
also	finding	out	about	the	informal	loan	network	immediately	is	not	easy
the	lender	is	the	one	who	controls	the	game
people	who	give	out	loans	know	that	informal	borrowers	are	often	in	situation	where	they	have	nothing	to	lose	and	will	do	whatever	it	takes	to	get	the	loan	in	time
this	causes	many	scams	that	tell	the	terms	of	the	loan	in	ambiguous	terms	or	confusing	the	borrower
finally	the	borrowers	cannot	know	how	much	they	currently	owe	because	the	lender	is	the	only	person	who	can	interpret	the	agreement	which	makes	the	borrower	become	just	chicken	in	their	hands
brutal	debt	collection	in	the	event	of	debtor	miss	payment	there	is	often	intimidation	harassment	or	embarrassment
in	many	cases	there	was	even	physical	harm	and	try	to	destroy	property	or	even	attack	their	family	or	close	people
moreover	data	from	the	debtor	assistance	center	and	people	who	have	not	been	treated	fairly	the	department	of	special	investigation	states	that	there	are	currently	types	of	scams	from	informal	debt	gangs	helmet	gang	daily	loan	without	contract	that	may	confiscate	credit	card	id	card	or	confiscate	the	card	of	the	guarantor
most	of	them	are	lending	to	merchants	in	the	market
these	gangs	are	spread	in	all	provinces	across	the	country	where	many	gangs	have	funding	from	the	same	large	capital
there	are	two	methods	of	horrifying	scams	of	the	helmet	gang	group	of	capitalists	who	make	an	advantageous	contract	most	of	the	debtors	are	farmers	with	the	land
previously	the	most	popular	form	of	sale	was	consignment	by	making	short	term	redemption	contract	then	the	debtor	cannot	find	the	money	to	redeem	the	money	back	in	time
so	the	land	which	is	worth	several	times	more	than	the	amount	borrowed	goes	to	the	creditor
but	after	the	government	had	major	crackdown	in	along	with	the	issuance	of	the	agriculture	land	sale	act	which	has	many	rules
as	result	the	contract	of	sale	of	deposit	to	seize	the	land	of	the	debtor	has	decreased
however	the	worry	is	that	creditors	are	currently	using	scams	to	get	the	debtors	into	new	contracts	by	allowing	the	debtor	to	transfer	the	land	to	the	creditor	before	receiving	the	money
when	the	payment	is	fully	paid	the	land	will	be	returned	by	contract	to	buy	and	sell
what	the	debtor	does	not	know	is	that	the	ownership	of	the	land	has	completely	changed	to	the	creditor	from	the	date	the	debtor	transfers	the	land	in	exchange	for	loan
also	the	land	price	is	worth	many	times	the	amount	borrowed
debtors	are	often	defrauded
then	by	the	time	of	redemption	the	creditor	will	avoid	receiving	payment
for	example	when	the	debtor	comes	to	pay	the	last	installment	the	creditor	will	not	be	found	by	claiming	that	he	is	not	at	home
online	loanswhich	the	target	group	will	be	online	sellers	employees	and	student	groups
for	online	seller	group	it	will	be	sharing	group	loan	where	the	loan	gang	will	check	the	history	of	online	sellers	and	people	who	will	join	the	sharing	group	whether	they	have	the	power	to	repay	the	debt	and	have	is	the	source	clear	or	not
then	they	will	make	friends	through	chat	and	when	they	get	acquainted	they	invite	them	to	form	sharing	group	loan
the	loan	gang	acts	as	group	owner
the	method	is	as	same	as	playing	common	shares	but	if	any	child	shares	have	no	money	to	pay	then	the	owner	will	persuade	another	group	to	join	another	band	to	pia	to	the	first	band
this	causes	the	debtor	to	own	more	debt
importantly	the	owner	will	act	as	an	informal	loan	source
if	the	child	shares	are	unable	to	pay	they	can	borrow	money	from	the	group	owner
if	the	debtor	cannot	repay	on	the	due	date	they	will	post	curse	on	the	facebook	page	or	call	their	lover	and	friends	of	debtors	that	are	on	facebook	causing	the	debtor	to	hurry	to	pay	the	debt	because	of	fear	of	being	condemned
the	reason	why	creditors	are	not	afraid	of	debtors	shutting	down	their	facebook	is	that	the	behavioral	analysis	of	social	media	users	it	shows	that	online	merchant	debtors	do	not	want	to	lose	their	customer	base	on	facebook	while	other	debtors	who	use	the	old	facebook	are	accustomed	to	using	it	and	do	not	want	to	add	new	friends
informal	debt	is	both	scary	and	dangerous
apart	from	being	exploited	and	losing	money	you	may	lose	your	house	your	land	or	your	reputation	get	hurt	or	even	risk	your	life
you	should	not	get	involved	but	if	you	have	any	financial	problem	loan	in	the	system	with	banks	like	scb	has	variety	of	options	to	help	customers	get	through	the	financial	crisis
the	personal	credit	speedy	loan	with	maximum	loan	limit	of	million	baht	plus	installments	up	to	months	without	the	need	for	securities	or	collateral
quick	approval	fast	money	plus	easy	to	register	which	is	online	via	mobile	phone
there	are	also	my	home	my	cash	loans	and	my	car	my	cash	loans	that	takes	your	home	or	car	as	collateral	for	your	loan	but	you	still	own	the	house	and	the	car
the	preliminary	approval	results	take	time	within	business	day
any	information	is	needed	about	finding	loan	that	is	right	for	you	call	references
the	pandemic	of	covid	has	separated	people	apart	and	has	affected	national	relationships	economy	social	community	and	individuals
it	causes	the	disruption	of	people	behavior	which	finally	becomes	new	normal
what	is	its	influence	on	the	digital	world	and	what	trend	is	to	be	followed	after	the	end	of	the	pandemic
moving	the	manufacturing	back	the	lock	down	around	the	world	causes	several	international	supply	dependent	nations	difficulty
the	worlds	most	important	manufacturing	base	in	china
so	the	idea	of	distributing	manufacturing	to	other	places	which	is	risk	management	is	increasing
this	includes	the	concept	of	self	reliance	in	many	countries
many	businesses	have	become	localized	or	have	sourced	from	multinationals
digital	takeover	technologies	become	part	of	normal	life	as	covid	catalyzes	people	to	live	digitally
hence	in	the	future	the	internet	will	become	basic	structure	provided	by	the	states	as	well	as	water	and	electricity
many	studies	show	that	more	digital	platforms	have	been	accessed	during	the	pandemic	for	variation	of	activities	including	studying	cooking	exercising	and	finding	virtual	things	to	do
the	marketplace	has	been	growing	fast
online	delivery	service	has	increased	tremendously
moreover	the	intact	relationship	which	reduces	touching	eventually	leads	to	technology	adoption	labor	reduction	as	it	eliminates	face	to	face	communication	as	well	as	introduction	cashless	society
the	cashless	society	allows	transactions	to	occur	digitally	which	includes	bill	payment	via	applications	payment	credit	card	and	mobile	banking	for	instance	scb	easy	application	which	consists	of	features	suitable	for	the	new	normal	and	youngsters	lifestyle	which	can	be	applied	here	changing	of	working	pattern	work	from	home	is	going	to	become	normal
many	companies	allow	their	employees	to	work	from	their	home	and	do	not	require	them	to	come	into	the	office	every	day	or	any	day
this	is	cost	reduction	on	office	rental	maintenance	and	office	supply
the	freed	up	space	can	also	be	leased
besides	some	employees	which	need	to	be	present	at	the	office	require	more	closed	working	environment	for	example	partition	to	be	installed	between	desks
moreover	online	meetings	will	become	ordinary	and	participants	are	no	longer	required	to	come	to	their	office
changing	of	employment	from	now	on	it	is	the	talent	market	as	companies	can	hire	them	from	anywhere	in	the	world
this	is	an	opportunity	for	brilliance	to	work	without	any	limitation	of	distance	and	place
employment	will	change	from	permanently	to	project	based	which	is	called	gig	economy
such	employment	is	temporary	and	results	in	changing	of	superior	inferior	relationship
this	is	going	to	affect	the	security	and	the	benefit	of	future	salary	people
on	the	other	hand	the	high	skilled	person	can	work	for	companies	and	get	paid	which	matches	their	ability
outdated	skilled	labor	will	be	laid	off	and	leads	to	higher	unemployment	rate
reshaping	social	security	from	now	on	the	world	is	going	to	spin	fast	with	uncertainties
economics	shall	be	driven	by	gig	economy	the	temporary	employment
this	will	definitely	make	ordinary	people	feel	insecure	as	they	do	not	have	certain	income	and	benefits
so	the	government	might	need	to	increase	the	provident	fund	or	enforce	measures	for	employers	to	participate	in	paying	employee	security	funds	when	needed	to	provide	security
big	data	is	closer	than	you	think	before	the	pandemic	organizations	used	big	data	to	improve	sales	and	marketing	by	analyzing	consumers	reducing	cost	and	making	more	accurate	decisions
after	the	covid	pandemic	big	data	has	become	closer	to	people	as	both	the	government	and	private	sectors	introduced	it	to	control	the	pandemic	and	risk	area	alert
moreover	it	has	been	used	to	utilize	people	data	for	issuing	the	helping	measure	from	the	government
therefore	employing	the	big	data	of	citizens	is	going	to	become	normal	as	people	are	willing	to	trade	in	their	privacy	for	safety
elevating	hygienic	standard	globally	during	the	pandemic	people	have	become	more	concerned	about	their	hygiene	including	wearing	mask	washing	hands	and	keeping	all	the	touchable	surfaces	cleaned
they	also	have	been	more	careful	when	touching	things	in	public
this	leads	to	the	new	hygienic	standard
furthermore	healthcare	and	prevention	platforms	will	become	more	important
the	basic	structure	of	the	city	building	and	home	shall	need	such	platform
hence	both	the	public	and	private	sectors	need	to	invest	in	the	mentioned	platform	to	ensure	consumers	safety
moreover	the	healthcare	system	will	be	developed	in	both	qualities	wise	and	accessibility	wise
medical	wellness	tourism	is	going	to	be	new	trendy	tour
also	people	will	consume	healthy	food	and	want	to	be	certain	that	the	food	they	consumed	is	clean	safe	and	meet	the	standard
they	are	willing	to	pay	for	high	quality	products	instead	of	the	low	and	lack	of	the	standard
economy	at	home	with	the	familiarity	of	working	and	doing	activities	at	home	peoples	demand	of	finding	residence	has	changed
instead	of	looking	for	place	in	the	city	center	close	to	the	subway	people	will	prefer	house	in	suburban	area	with	more	space	for	activities
since	there	is	no	need	to	go	out	for	activities	and	familiar	with	indoor	on	demand	activities	including	cooking	gardening	watching	netflix	exercising	and	tiktok	challenging
these	activities	have	created	new	trend	called	new	luxury	which	is	the	need	of	having	equipment	to	create	happiness	inside	the	house	for	example	coffee	maker	air	fryers
the	above	mentioned	new	normals	is	closer	than	ever	as	they	have	become	peoples	new	normal	for	at	least	years	until	the	vaccine	is	launched
then	will	the	new	normal	still	be	familiar	part	of	our	life
we	have	to	wait	and	see

if	we	talk	about	the	top	trending	application	everyone	should	have	heard	of	tiktok
people	can	make	short	vdo	clip	with	this	app
from	sensor	tower	report	it	is	the	highest	download	count	except	games	in	may	alone	with	million	downloads	which	is	double	when	compared	to	zoom	and	whatsapp	respectively	in	the	popularity	of	tiktok	is	not	just	coincidence
it	has	mesmerized	mark	zuckerberg	and	he	has	kept	his	eyes	on	this	chinese	application
lets	get	to	know	more	about	this	application
from	chinas	startup	to	worlds	most	valued	application	tiktok	is	the	name	that	is	known	among	people	around	the	world	but	it	is	actually	originated	from	china	called	douyin
it	is	difficult	for	international	users	to	recognize	chinese	names	so	they	changed	it	to	tiktok
the	application	was	developed	by	bytedance	launched	in	and	currently	has	million	active	users	per	day
the	business	has	valued	at	approximately	billion	about	trillion	baht	and	it	is	also	the	world	most	valued	startup	application
it	was	then	invested	by	softbank	japanese	it	company	and	the	application	main	target	audience	is	teenagers	aged	between	although	initially	tiktok	primarily	focused	on	the	teenage	market	in	asia	recent	report	from	qustodio	an	app	that	helps	parents	control	their	children	online	behavior	has	surveyed	about	households	in	the	united	states	uk	and	spain
they	found	that	from	february	to	april	american	children	spent	an	average	of	minutes	on	tiktok	per	day	which	second	only	to	youtube	at	an	average	of	minutes	per	day
tiktok	is	very	popular	among	children	in	these	three	countries
americans	spend	minutes	which	increases	to	uk	spend	minutes	which	increases	to	spain	spends	minutes	which	increases	to
it	is	undeniable	that	tiktok	has	become	very	popular	among	gen	right	now
how	to	do	marketing	on	gen
in	the	beginning	tiktok	targeted	gen	by	choosing	influencers	who	have	good	looking	and	glamorous	lifestyles	to	attract	new	users	to	follow	and	re	shares
they	also	invited	influencers	who	are	popular	in	the	application	to	help	promote	as	well
they	spend	more	than	billion	rmb	to	use	selected	influencers	to	increase	their	number	of	followers	up	to	each	which	will	give	tiktok	total	number	of	followers	to	reach	billion
after	tiktok	has	gained	massive	influencers	they	joined	hands	with	partners	to	promote	their	products	by	using	influencers	to	make	vdo	clips	for	people	to	follow	and	re	create
for	example	hai	di	lao	hot	pot	restaurant	invented	new	menus	to	join	this	campaign
this	strategy	worked	as	result	they	have	got	massive	sales	from	this	campaign
in	addition	the	app	strength	lies	in	the	development	of	an	easy	to	use	user	interface
there	are	features	such	as	effects	filters	templates	adjust	speed	compose	sound	and	add	background	music
it	is	very	easy	to	create	vdo	clip	and	doesnt	require	any	skills
with	clever	marketing	strategy	less	than	year	after	it	was	launched	it	has	reached	million	users	which	is	one	of	the	biggest	tiktok	successes
tiktoks	algorithm	people	who	are	familiar	with	facebook	will	know	that	in	order	to	get	more	likes	and	engagement	in	addition	to	the	conventional	method	you	have	to	buy	ads	to	make	your	page	more	visible	to	users
but	it	is	different	for	tiktok	number	of	followers	do	not	affect	the	engagement
it	depends	on	how	popular	your	vdo	clip	is	the	more	likes	you	got	the	more	it	become	visible	to	users
for	example	when	someone	uploads	new	vdo	the	system	will	only	show	to	some	users	based	on	various	engagement	histories	whether	they	would	be	interested	in	this	or	not
then	the	system	will	see	if	people	is	actually	watching	like	comment	and	share
then	it	will	take	into	account	whether	this	clip	should	be	shown	to	more	people	or	not
that	means	if	you	do	very	good	content	chances	that	the	system	will	show	it	to	more	people	is	possible
the	system	will	track	that	out	of	people	who	see	the	vdo	will	give	like	and	if	within	day	people	like	more	than	of	the	total	number	of	views	the	vdo	clip	will	be	spread	out	to	wider	audience
it	can	be	said	that	you	don	need	lot	of	followers	but	make	good	content	and	get	likes
the	chances	that	the	vdo	will	become	viral	with	millions	of	views	is	possible	overnight	unlike	facebook	or	youtube	which	you	must	have	large	number	of	fans	or	subscribers	to	have	greater	chance	of	seeing
how	to	become	tiktoks	rising	star	to	become	tiktoks	rising	star	isnt	difficult	just	follow	the	aforementioned	and	create	interesting	content	and	follow	these	rules

if	you	take	the	money	that	the	company	compensated	to	pay	afraid	that	there	would	be	no	money	to	use	along	the	way	because	it	takes	time	to	deliver	before	being	able	to	sell
in	this	time	of	crisis	it	is	hard	to	find	new	job
and	the	younger	brother	has	always	worked	in	hotels
which	is	known	as	the	first	business	which	has	been	affected	the	most

think	again	and	again
how	to	help
normally	my	brother	is	the	kind	who	does	not	like	to	borrow	money	from	anyone	even	myself	or	relatives
where	can	he	get	money	from	that	he	doesn	need	to	reconcile	with	anyone
thinking	for	while	have	this	idea
credit	card	change	the	remaining	credit	limit	from	credit	card	to	change	to	cash	transfer	to	the	account
have	seen	this	function	when	paying	for	the	scb	credit	card	via	the	easy	app
and	familiar	that	the	younger	brother	has	an	scb	credit	card	and	is	not	used	because	he	likes	to	pay	by	cash
before	calling	my	brother	then	try	to	look	into	the	scb	easy	app	first	to	check	if	it	difficult	or	not
incredibly	convenient	plus	the	benefits	of	using	the	account	transfer	service	are	better	to	press	cash	through	an	atm	without	having	to	pay	cash	advance	fee
and	the	full	details	of	the	bank	interest	rate	how	much	per	percent	per	month	how	much	will	the	total	payment	be
how	much	is	the	principal
what	is	the	interest
what	is	the	monthly	payment
to	check	the	information	again	before	deciding	is	very	good
because	customers	will	know	all	the	information	from	the	beginning	whether	it	is	number	that	they	can	accept	or	not
very	fast	and	easy	also	suitable	for	the	habit	of	the	younger	brother	who	does	not	like	to	talk	to	anyone	and	does	not	like	anyone	to	know	about	personal	matters
after	having	finished	playing	call	the	brother	immediately
which	he	said	is	very	good	way	for	him	now	because	the	remaining	credit	limit	is	enough	to	pay	the	supplier
plus	installments	up	to	ten	months
this	makes	the	amount	that	is	not	very	high	to	pay	making	it	easier	to	expand	anything
at	that	time	things	could	start	to	sell	or	maybe	find	new	job	as	well
because	of	various	situations	should	be	better	for	anyone	who	is	having	trouble	with	money	let	scb	credit	cards	change	to	cash	so	you	have	more	time	to	breathe
do	it	yourself	easily	at	home	via	the	scb	easy	app
it	takes	no	more	than	minutes
cash	will	be	credited	to	your	account	immediately
every	crisis	every	problem	has	solution	with	us	all	go	through	this	difficult	situation	together
an	emergency	fund	is	an	amount	of	money	that	many	people	try	to	save	for	emergencies	such	as	sudden	loss	of	job	or	medical	fees	house	renovation	car	reparation	that	is	caused	by	accident	or	natural	disaster
however	if	the	emergency	fund	is	not	enough	and	it	is	impossible	to	borrow	from	other	people	everything	could	get	much	worse	than	we	thought
therefore	there	is	financial	product	that	is	called	cash	card	to	aid	people	whose	life	has	almost	meet	the	dead	end	to	look	for	the	way	out	and	move	forward
at	the	same	time	it	could	be	used	as	an	option	for	installment	according	to	the	promotions	as	well
cash	card	is	kind	of	revolving	credit	in	form	of	card	that	allows	users	to	conveniently	carry	it	with	them	everywhere	and	use	during	an	emergency	without	withdrawal	and	card	charges
also	it	is	very	easy	to	register
there	is	no	need	for	security	and	surety
when	there	is	need	to	use	the	money	just	bring	the	debit	card	and	withdraw	cash	from	atm	machines	from	any	banks	that	have	atm	pool	sign	countrywide
benefits	of	debit	card	debit	card	is	considered	good	emergency	fund	without	annual	charges
if	cash	is	not	withdrawn	there	are	no	additional	charges	that	users	have	to	pay
for	anyone	who	has	already	registered	and	has	their	financial	amount	approved	if	the	first	transfer	is	made	the	bank	will	transfer	this	emergency	fund	into	the	account	immediately	or	the	next	time	whenever	there	is	need	for	cash	users	can	withdraw	cash	from	the	atm	pool	machines	over	the	country	for	hours
this	is	like	having	financial	limit	that	can	be	withdrawn	anytime	to	be	ready	for	any	unexpected	events	that	can	happen	in	life
constraints	of	debit	card	cash	withdrawal	by	using	debit	card	despite	not	having	withdrawal	fees	users	still	have	to	pay	interest	according	to	the	number	of	days	and	amount	of	cash	withdrawn
the	interest	rate	of	the	debit	cards	might	be	higher	than	other	types	of	credit	and	the	interest	is	calculated	daily
there	is	no	grace	period	like	credit	card	except	if	it	is	used	in	installment	promotion
the	faster	the	users	pay	the	lesser	the	interest
however	if	users	delay	in	their	payment	or	only	pay	minimum	amount	they	will	have	to	pay	more	interest
thus	to	prevent	the	interest	to	keep	marching	forward	after	the	cash	is	withdrawn	one	must	return	the	money	as	soon	as	possible	without	waiting	for	the	bill
techniques	to	use	debit	card	to	its	best	ability	to	be	financially	disciplined	saving	enough	cash	into	the	bank	account	for	emergency	use	when	something	unexpected	happened	for	examples	loss	of	jobs	sickness	or	encountering	of	an	accident	that	causes	one	to	be	unable	to	continue	their	profession	this	amount	of	money	will	allow	one	to	not	use	debit	card	to	withdraw	cash	more	than	necessary

google	even	if	the	digital	giant	google	was	not	been	attached	data	breach
but	google	was	fined	million	euros	around	million	baht	because	users	couldn	easily	access	the	consumer	data	processing	statement
and	the	language	used	to	describe	it	is	ambiguous	moreover	google	is	guilty	of	not	asking	consumers	for	consent	to	request	data	for	targeting	advertising	campaigns	against	gdpr	laws
austrian	post	in	early	the	austrian	post	the	austrian	post	office	was	fined	million	euros	about	million	baht	by	the	national	data	protection	agency

million	baht	for	guilty	of	keeping	the	consumer	sensitive	data	longer	than	necessary	without	legitimate	justification
telecom	gmbh	case	of	german	company	telecom	gmbh	has	been	fined	million	euros	about	million	baht
in	the	offense	that	the	company	call	center	does	not	have	adequate	standards	to	protect	and	maintain	customer	data	both	technical	and	corporate	policy
authorities	found	that	people	calling	the	company	call	center	were	able	to	retrieve	customer	information	by	simply	entering	their	name	and	date	of	birth
this	is	the	fault	of	an	organization	that	does	not	have	strict	authentication	and	data	protection	measures	in	accordance	with	the	gdpr
these	are	the	six	highest	fines	for	violating	the	eu	general	data	protection	regulation	gdpr
this	is	case	study	for	agencies	organizations	companies	and	people	in	thailand	to	learn	and	acknowledge	as	guideline	to	follow	as	well
reference
in	an	age	when	information	is	valuable	as	result	there	must	be	the	promulgation	of	the	personal	data	protection	act	or	pdpa	personal	data	protection	act
to	establish	rules	mechanisms	and	measures	for	the	collection	use	or	disclosure	of	personal	information	to	be	correct
prevent	violations	of	privacy	rights	as	well	as	having	remedial	measures	for	the	personal	data	breach
and	there	are	penalties	for	those	who	do	not	follow	from	may	onwards	this	act	will	be	in	full	force	for	both	private	and	corporate	organizations
therefore	there	must	be	storage	measure	and	the	use	of	personal	information	only	to	the	extent	with	the	consent	of	the	data	subject
including	destroying	after	the	storage	period
data	subjects	also	must	know	their	rights	to	protect	personal	information
including	giving	consent	as	appropriate
because	our	data	can	be	used	for	analysis	research	for	product	development
or	services	to	meet	the	needs	or	may	be	used	for	illegal	purposes	can	bring	trouble	for	the	data	subject	as	well	but	do	you	know
many	times	personal	information	escapes	from	the	data	subject
which	causes	the	information	to	leak	what	happened
let	see
unknowingly	giving	information	many	of	you	have	probably	heard	the	warning	to	be	careful	posting	pictures	or	messages	on	social	media
for	example	should	not	post	anything	that	can	be	linked	to	the	owner	of	the	information	such	as	name	surname	vehicle	registration	phone	number	email	address	fingerprint	or	barcode	etc
but	sometimes	the	information	we	give	although	not	publicly	released	but	chat	in	group	of	friends	or	contact	online	trading	it	may	cause	personal	information	to	escape	if	someone	enters	the	group
or	disguise	themselves	as	customers
for	example	the	account	number	may	be	used	as	an	illegal	remittance	account
to	complicate	the	origin	and	investigate
once	the	money	has	been	transferred	it	will	be	contacted	to	request	refund	from	the	account	holder	later
claiming	to	transfer	money	to	the	wrong	account	or	maybe	used	the	car	registration	number	to	spoof	in	order	to	transport	illegal	things	or	committing	crime	etc
of	information	or	be	led	to	believe	various	online	media	such	as	websites	mail	sms	or	social	media	such	as	facebook	line	twitter	etc
are	all	fake	in	order	to	be	mistaken	for	companies	or	organizations
that	we	may	use	the	service
which	will	entice	the	owner	of	the	information	to	fill	in	or	give	some	information
if	giving	information	to	it	can	cause	damage	to	the	owner	of	the	data
the	things	that	fake	accounts	often	ask	for	information	include	passwords	atm	codes	credit	cards	national	id	numbers	etc
therefore	if	you	receive	message	that	leads	to	filling	or	providing	any	personal	information	must	first	make	sure	that	is	the	contact	from	reliable	source
or	just	pretending	to	be	just	deceitful
providing	information	without	knowing	the	origins	of	the	author	participating	in	various	activities	such	as	guessing	activities	from	numbers	or	from	logging	in	via	social	media
to	do	the	test	or	join	different	activities
may	need	to	include	mobile	number	car	registration	id	card	number	or	extracting	information	on	social	media
this	information	can	be	easily	linked	and	identified	with	the	owner	of	the	information
therefore	we	will	fill	in	what	information	or	press	what	consent
if	the	origin	of	the	author	is	not	known	is	like	giving	information	to	an	unknown	person
and	what	he	would	do	with	that	information	we	did	not	know
therefore	need	to	look	at	the	necessity	and	the	reliability	of	those	to	whom	we	are	going	to	provide	information
disposal	or	reuse	of	documents	who	has	ever	dropped	documents	such	as	water	bills	electricity	bills	telephone	bills	or	mail	parcels	addressed	to	us
or	bring	the	said	document	to	reuse	must	be	careful
the	documents	mentioned	above	will	include	your	name	address	and	may	include	our	phone	number	or	email	address
this	personal	information	can	identify	who	we	are	where	to	contact
think	about	it	if	the	criminals	get	this	information
it	can	be	used	to	do	bad	things	such	as	surveillance	of	dwellings	in	order	to	steal	things
or	kidnapping	someone	in	the	house	or	it	may	become	an	illegal	delivery	channel
became	scapegoat	without	being	caught	off	guard	therefore	documents	or	parcels	with	personal	information	should	be	destroyed	to	be	inconclusive	every	time
putting	personal	information	where	it	is	easily	noticed	in	the	dramas	or	movies	that	we	have	watched	you	should	have	seen	scene	where	detective	secretly	uses	cell	phone	camera	to	take	pictures	of	other	people	documents
for	example	it	could	be	schedule	for	an	important	appointment	or	vacation	plan
that	the	owner	may	have	placed	thinking	that	it	is	okay
but	this	information	can	be	used	to	track	stalk	or	know	when	we	are	at	home	and	not	at	home	as	well
even	though	the	personal	information	protection	act	came	into	force	to	protect	the	rights	of	the	data	subject
but	ourselves	as	the	subject	of	personal	information	must	know	to	collect	use	and	disseminate	our	personal	information	and	does	not	violate	the	privacy	of	others	as	well
this	article	will	talk	about	the	japanese	way	of	managing	human	resources	which	is	one	of	the	factors	in	japanese	corporate	style	of	human	resources	management	apart	from	teamwork	japanese	recruiting	system	employee	management	theory	and	japanese	way	of	managing	human	resources
japanese	style	management	japanese	style	management	is	full	of	many	details
this	article	will	choose	only	the	method	that	is	widely	used	in	almost	every	japanese	company	and	is	effective	and	widely	acknowledged
it	is	called	the	pdca	cycle
it	is	method	of	management	that	is	popularly	used	in	japanese	manufacturing	since	the	end	of	world	war	ii
stands	for	plan
it	is	method	of	planning	based	on	fact	which	is	piece	of	information	that	can	be	measured	and	evaluated	and	not	opinion
the	facts	that	will	be	used	in	planning	will	be	that	of	the	past	and	present	to	do	future	planning
stands	for	do
it	has	the	literal	meaning	which	is	to	carry	out	the	plan	stands	for	check
it	is	process	of	consideration	if	the	plan	can	really	be	carried	out
the	important	process	that	check	can	go	smoothly	is	to	construct	plan	that	can	be	measured	and	evaluated
if	the	plan	is	just	intangible	and	cannot	be	evaluated	this	process	will	also	deem	ineffective
represents	act
it	is	process	of	correction
process	that	searches	for	the	parts	that	do	not	go	according	to	the	plan	and	analyses	the	reasons	and	fix	them
there	are	important	points	of	pdca
the	first	one	is	pdca	has	to	be	done	constantly	in	cycle
when	process	is	done	data	will	continue	to	be	collected	to	use	in	the	next	planning
when	the	whole	cycle	of	pdca	is	completed	the	next	cycle	of	pdca	will	start	to	roll
therefore	there	can	be	fiscal	year	pdca	quarterly	pdca	monthly	pdca	or	weekly	pdca
pdca	cycle	will	be	beneficial	for	some	organizations	that	stop	at	only	without	going	on	to	do	dca	or	some	organizations	that	only	do	pd	without	doing	ca
apart	from	that	another	point	of	practicing	pdca	is	that	pdca	will	have	to	go	according	to	the	goal	of	the	organization
most	of	the	time	pdca	is	right	but	it	does	not	go	along	with	the	goal
this	causes	the	organization	to	lose	money	time	and	manpower	without	meeting	the	demand	of	the	organization	itself
now	we	will	be	talking	about	communication	method	called	horenso	which	is	an	effective	communication	process
horenso	is	word	formed	by	combining	abbreviations	of	hokoku	renraku	and	sodan	together
ho	is	an	abbreviation	from	hokoku	which	means	to	report
it	is	to	update	on	any	process	of	the	on	going	work	or	the	completed	work	and	report	to	the	higher	ups
it	is	usually	reported	in	terms	of	who	what	where	when	why	and	how	for	the	commanders	to	know	the	status	of	the	project	as	much	as	the	information	we	have
ren	is	abbreviated	from	renkaku	which	means	to	inform
it	is	to	inform	facts	without	personal	opinions	for	any	relevant	individuals	to	know
when	there	is	problem	at	work	or	there	is	any	missing	personal	and	team	members	have	to	be	informed	this	is	also	classified	under	renkaku
so	is	an	abbreviation	of	sodan	which	means	to	discuss
it	is	process	under	the	condition	that	we	do	not	have	the	authority	to	make	decision	or	are	in	the	dark	to	solve	the	problem
the	issue	will	be	brought	up	to	discuss	with	higher	ranking	personals
horenso	will	have	to	be	carried	out	simultaneously
for	instant	when	there	is	problem	that	cannot	be	decided	by	ourselves	and	authority	from	higher	ranking	personals	is	needed	ho	and	ren	should	be	done	before	so	can	happen
the	leaders	should	be	reported	and	informed	on	this	matter	before	it	was	brought	up	to	discuss
besides	some	japanese	companies	practice	putting	abbreviations	on	the	email	titles	whether	it	is	ho	ren	or	so	email	to	save	time	for	recipients	as	they	can	understand	the	purpose	of	this	email	easier
the	last	method	that	will	be	mentioned	is	japanese	style	decision	making
this	is	called	nemawashi	and	ringi
the	real	meaning	of	nemawashi	is	actually	to	spade	up	tree	to	move	to	another	location	without	severing	the	roots
the	word	is	then	used	to	describe	an	informal	negotiation	in	japan
because	japanese	style	management	does	not	have	top	down	feature	like	in	thailand
japanese	managers	do	not	have	absolute	power	that	their	job	is	merely	to	pass	down	orders	and	people	under	them	will	take	action
therefore	japanese	managers	will	always	have	to	start	conversation	or	arrange	drinking	party	to	negotiate	with	team	members	or	their	subordinates	to	get	rough	idea	of	how	they	think	before	making	important	decisions
it	seems	like	an	informal	meeting	to	get	rough	idea	before	the	actual	one
that	is	why	the	word	spade	up	is	used	to	describe	this	kind	of	negotiation
ringi	is	polar	opposite	of	nemawashi	because	ringi	is	an	official	approval
normally	after	nemawashi	and	the	team	gets	to	the	final	decision	ringi	will	follow
it	comes	in	the	form	of	circular	letter	that	everyone	in	every	department	will	have	to	acknowledge	to	establish	group	consensus
this	is	because	japanese	style	management	focuses	on	teamwork
so	before	every	important	decision	there	must	be	group	consensus	and	proof	that	everybody	really	agrees
most	japanese	style	management	will	then	practice	namewashi	and	followed	by	ringi	to	obtain	group	consensus
pdca	horenso	communication	and	namewashi	and	ringi	decision	making	style	are	parts	and	parcels	of	effective	japanese	style	management	and	thai	organizations	can	adapt	this	to	use	in	their	organizations	as	well

pdpa	or	personal	data	protection	act	which	was	completely	official	on	may	is	closer	to	us	than	we	think
it	does	not	matter	if	we	are	customers	employees	or	juristic	person	we	are	all	bound	to	involve	with	personal	data	under	this	act
the	importance	of	pdpa	is	to	protect	the	information	about	an	individual	that	allows	others	to	directly	or	indirectly	detect	that	individual	such	as	name	surname	address	identification	number	mobile	number	email	educational	background	job	experience	financial	information	medical	record	the	criminal	record	including	biometric	etc
all	these	are	protected	in	order	to	prevent	the	violation	of	data	subjects	privacy	that	could	lead	to	troubles	and	losses
data	subject	rights	according	to	the	personal	data	protection	act	are	as	followed	right	to	be	informed	in	the	collection	of	personal	information	the	data	controller	will	have	to	report	the	details	of	data	collection	all	the	way	to	the	usage	or	disclosure	to	the	data	subject	before	any	action	or	during	the	data	collection	process	except	data	subject	is	well	aware	of	the	details	for	example	information	for	opening	bank	account	or	registration	for	product	trial	and	services
the	data	subject	has	all	rights	to	know	the	objective	of	the	collection	usage	and	disclosure	of	their	information	details	of	the	information	that	will	be	collected	duration	of	the	collection	as	well	as	information	of	the	data	controller	such	as	location	and	contact	as	well	as	consequences	of	not	revealing	the	information
right	of	access	the	data	subject	has	the	right	to	access	and	ask	for	copy	of	their	personal	data	from	data	controller
they	can	also	ask	for	the	revelation	of	how	their	personal	data	is	obtained	in	the	case	that	they	are	in	doubt	if	consent	has	been	given
nevertheless	the	right	to	access	will	be	granted	as	long	as	it	is	not	going	against	the	law	or	court	decree	and	the	exercise	of	the	right	does	not	violate	the	right	and	freedom	of	others
right	to	data	portability	in	the	case	that	data	subject	would	like	to	use	their	personal	information	that	was	given	to	one	data	controller	to	another	data	controller	for	example	the	first	data	controller	has	stored	the	personal	information	into	different	forms	that	can	be	automatically	accessed	the	data	subject	can	request	for	those	data	from	the	data	controller	or	request	for	the	information	to	be	directly	sent	to	other	data	controller	if	the	method	and	technique	permit
nevertheless	the	exercise	of	the	right	must	not	go	against	the	law	contract	or	violate	the	right	and	freedom	of	others
right	to	object	the	data	subjects	can	oppose	the	collection	usage	or	disclosure	of	personal	data	whenever	they	desire	as	well	as	make	their	personal	data	becomes	anonymous	except	if	there	is	legal	need	for	the	information	only
right	to	erasure	right	to	be	forgotten	if	the	data	controller	reveals	the	personal	information	to	the	public	or	makes	it	easily	accessible	the	data	subject	has	the	right	to	request	for	their	information	to	be	erased	or	destroyed	the	information	or	rendered	it	anonymous
in	which	the	data	controller	will	have	to	be	responsible	for	both	technology	and	expenses	to	fulfill	the	request
right	towithdraw	consent	in	the	case	that	the	data	subject	gave	consent	for	the	usage	of	their	information	and	later	changed	their	mind	they	can	withdraw	the	consent	at	any	time
nevertheless	the	withdrawal	of	consent	must	not	go	against	the	legal	consent	or	contract	that	is	beneficial	to	the	data	subject
right	to	restrict	processing	data	subject	has	the	right	to	request	data	controller	to	halt	the	usage	of	personal	information
it	does	not	matter	if	data	subject	changed	their	mind	and	withdraw	consent	or	changed	their	mind	about	erasure	of	information	when	reaches	its	due	date	because	they	need	to	use	the	information	in	legal	matters	or	claim	rights	the	right	to	restrict	the	usage	of	personal	information	can	be	done
right	of	rectification	the	data	subject	has	the	right	to	amend	their	personal	information	to	make	the	information	accurate	up	to	date	and	does	not	cause
in	which	the	amendment	must	be	done	with	integrity	and	does	not	go	against	the	law
according	to	the	stated	laws	and	do	not	violate	the	right	or	freedom	of	others
also	we	should	always	bear	in	mind	that	our	personal	information	if	it	is	being	used	in	the	right	way	it	will	be	beneficial	to	the	data	subject
however	if	it	falls	into	the	hand	of	ill	intent	people	it	could	cause	problems	and	losses	to	the	data	subject	as	well

personal	information	protection	act	also	known	as	the	pdpa	which	stands	for	the	personal	data	protection	act
the	pdpa	is	law	based	on	the	eu	personal	data	protection	law	abbreviated	gdrp
this	stands	for	the	general	data	protection	regulation	and	this	law	has	big	impact	on	websites	active	in	the	eu
almost	every	website	uses	cookies	to	collect	information	and	behavior	of	website	visitors
since	the	thai	pdpa	currently	has	not	specifically	specified	the	cookie
while	today	our	own	home	uses	various	websites	or	online	systems
is	normal	in	daily	life	and	just	like	various	websites	around	the	world	that	use	cookies	to	collect	user	information	as	well
today	we	are	going	to	discuss	the	gdpr	regarding	the	use	of	cookies	on	websites	and	requesting	consent	from	users
as	an	example	the	implementation	of	the	thai	pdpa	which	is	similar
those	who	regularly	surf	the	internet	are	probably	familiar	with	the	term	cookies
there	are	many	benefits	of	it	such	as	helping	us	not	have	to	log	in	to	websites	that	have	previously	been	viewed
or	just	fill	out	form	that	has	already	been	filled	out
and	very	clear	is	the	ability	to	make	websites	display	information	that	we	like	or	care	about	which	may	be	considered	plus
but	the	danger	is	not	small	whether	it	spying	on	our	personal	information	to	send	advertisements	on	our	computers	or	sometimes	even	being	hacked	into	deposit	account	again
what	is	cookie
cookies	in	computer	language	is	an	http	header	form	of	text	consisting	of	each	website	and	will	be	recorded	on	our	browser	when	we	visit	that	website
the	main	objective	is	to	enable	website	owners	to	store	certain	information	in	the	user	web	browser
such	as	forms	that	have	previously	been	filled	out	data	recorded	that	had	previously	been	to	this	website	information	on	various	settings	of	the	website
the	first	web	browser	that	uses	cookies	is	netscape	navigator
types	of	cookies	cookies	of	websites	that	we	visit	personally	created	cookies	or	third	party	websites	which	other	websites	that	is	the	owner	of	certain	content	such	as	an	advertisement	created	by	as	mentioned	in	the	beginning	cookies	are	useful	but	not	least
because	your	personal	information	may	be	smuggled	back	to	unwanted	websites	leading	to	the	hacking	of	account	information	especially	information	regarding	online	transactions	who	shopping	online	often	should	be	more	careful	what	is	the	european	union	the	general	data	protection	regulation	gdrp	requirements	for	requesting	consent	to	collect	cookies	for	website	users
gdrp	cookie	consent	regulations	regarding	obtaining	permission	or	consent	to	use	cookies	from	users

before	making	loan	decision	in	addition	to	having	to	look	at	various	features	to	ensure	that	the	loan	can	pass
one	important	point	to	ask	yourself	is	whether	you	can	pay
because	once	they	have	borrowed	money	they	must	be	in	debtor	position	and	must	pay	the	debt	which	is	rule	of	the	debtor	who	must	comply
but	when	it	time	to	pay	the	debt	the	debtors	refused	to	pay
creditors	also	have	the	right	to	reimburse	or	hire	an	agent	who	is	debt	collection	business
of	course	there	is	no	debtor	who	wants	to	deform	the	debt
because	aside	from	losing	credit	history	maybe	pursued	by	debt	in	various	ways
however	if	it	is	debtor	of	financial	institution	under	the	supervision	of	the	bank	of	thailand	bot
even	if	it	is	an	overdue	debtor	have	the	right	to	receive	appropriate	treatment	for	example	creditors	must	collect	debt	only	during	the	specified	time	monday	friday	at	eight	clock	in	the	morning	to	two	clock	only
in	addition	those	who	are	responsible	for	debt	collection	must	use	the	method	and	say	it	in	polite	way
show	yourself	when	following	up	on	debt	collection
do	not	use	intimidation	use	of	force	or	demand	unfair	debt
such	as	collecting	fees	or	expenses	in	excess	of	the	specified	rate	etc
for	debtors	if	you	realize	that	you	are	unable	to	pay	off	the	debt	and	have	chance	of	being	repaid	must	first	compose	and	recited	by	heart	that	must	be	good	debtor	don	be	afraid	of	debt	collection
when	the	debt	collection	department	calls	to	collect	the	debt	the	debtor	does	not	talk	in	shaking	voice	or	using	voice	that	makes	the	other	person	knows	that	he	feels	fear
but	must	dare	to	talk	to	show	confidence	and	cope	because	don	forget	that	debt	is	civil	case	not	criminal	case
if	the	debtor	is	threatened	by	the	debt	collection	department	that	if	not	paying	the	debt	must	be	put	in	jail	then	respond	that	liability	is	civil	case	not	criminal	case	that	means	the	creditors	couldn	bring	the	police	to	arrest
ask	clearly	cannot	deny	that	when	the	debtor	receives	call	from	the	debt	collection	department	will	wait	to	answer	the	question
but	in	truth	the	debtor	must	first	ask	questions
start	by	asking	for	first	and	last	name	the	workplace	and	telephone	number	of	the	debt	collector
then	ask	deeper	question
for	example	do	you	now	know	how	much	the	debtor	has	paid
how	much	debt	remains
if	paid	now	how	much	will	the	interest	be	adjusted	per	year	etc
questioning	in	this	way	will	make	the	debt	collection	department	feel	that	the	debtor	knows	the	truth	and	understands	the	rules	and	regulations	for	debt	collection
importantly	it	does	not	cause	intimidation	or	harassment	in	debt	collection
voice	record	before	the	debtor	answered	the	question	don	forget	to	request	permission	to	record	with	polite	words
because	if	there	is	problem	such	as	being	intimidated	you	can	use	the	recorded	audio	to	be	useful	in	the	investigation
answer	the	phone	every	time	it	is	normal	that	the	debtor	does	not	like	the	creditor	to	call	to	ask	for	debt
or	didnt	receive	the	call	when	the	creditor	called	or	said	that	it	was	still	not	convenient	and	will	call	back	later
but	finally	quietly	disappeared
in	fact	if	the	debtor	wants	to	show	sincerity	it	should	answer	the	creditors	phone	every	time
at	the	same	time	it	must	explain	with	reason	and	tell	the	truth	about	the	problem	of	not	being	able	to	pay	the	debt	as	scheduled
if	doing	this	will	lead	to	finding	solution	together
call	the	creditor	first
when	there	are	signs	that	it	is	not	possible	to	pay	the	debt	as	scheduled	to	show	sincerity	it	should	contact	the	creditor	with	reason	and	promise	to	pay	the	debt	when
this	approach	in	addition	to	demonstrating	responsibility	is	also	good	relationship
may	also	allow	creditors	to	pay	off	debt	repayment
when	being	demanded	by	debt	the	debtor	solution	is	debt	negotiation
there	are	many	ways	depending	on	the	creditors	policies	such	as	requesting	to	reduce	some	debt	requesting	an	extension	of	repayment	period	such	as	year	years	request	to	reduce	the	number	of	installments	required	in	each	installment	for	example	from	baht	to	baht	requesting	to	stop	interest	during	installments	do	not	charge	fees	during	installments	or	requesting	the	use	of	collateral	to	pay	off	the	debt	etc
nobody	wants	to	be	in	debt	but	when	unable	to	pay	the	debt
aside	from	being	subject	to	interest	adjustment	losing	financial	history	and	might	encounter	with	being	called	for	payment	each	day
therefore	if	thinking	of	creating	debt	must	recite	the	spell	got	in	debt	as	necessary	and	able	to	afford	remind	this	in	your	mind

technique	no
adjust	the	transferring	limit	amount	as	you	wish	the	pain	point	in	the	past	is	the	limitation	of	transferring	amounts	for	large	sum	but	for	scb	easy	application	is	much	better
as	you	can	choose	your	own	limit	for	each	time	depending	on	your	need	you	do	not	have	to	worry	about	the	limit	being	too	high	or	too	low	which	makes	your	life	more	convenient	and	safer

the	most	common	financial	transaction	mistakes	that	are	made	are	wrong	account	transfer
there	are	many	reasons	such	as	incorrect	account	number	entry
enter	numbers	alternately	incomplete	or	may	be	caused	by	entering	the	wrong	account	number	between	the	money	transfer	channel	and	the	money	transfer	channel	via	promptpay
or	enter	the	correct	account	number	but	chose	the	wrong	bank	to	transfer
including	rushing	to	make	transaction	until	forgetting	to	check	the	name	of	the	destination	account	before	pressing	transfer
when	the	wrong	account	transfer	occurs	or	transfers	money	in	excess	of	the	amount	if	we	know	the	owner	of	the	destination	account	very	well	such	as	being	family	member	or	close	friends	then	we	can	contact	to	request	refund	immediately
but	if	unable	to	contact	or	the	sender	does	not	know	the	owner	of	the	destination	account	must	go	through	the	legal	refund	process
for	wrong	account	transfer	according	to	law	the	bank	will	not	be	able	to	transfer	the	money	back	to	the	wrong	payer
if	the	owner	of	the	destination	account	does	not	agree
because	the	bank	does	not	have	the	right	to	pull	money	from	the	account	arbitrarily
but	the	bank	will	be	the	intermediary	to	help	coordinate	the	refund	only
by	referring	to	information	from	the	financial	consumer	protection	center	bank	of	thailand	bot	regarding	the	wrong	transfer	of	money	to	the	account	owner	who	transferred	the	wrong	money	proceed	as	follows	the	things	that	the	wrong	account	owner	of	the	money	transfer	must	do	however	the	best	way	to	prevent	money	transfers	from	accounts	is	the	period	before	clicking	transfer	confirmation
must	check	the	account	number	promptpay	number	account	name	bank	name	and	amount	to	be	transferred	correctly	every	time
the	wrong	transfer	of	money	must	be	resolved
but	if	being	sober	and	examined	carefully	before	transferring	will	be	the	best	protection

people	all	over	the	world	are	waiting	for	vaccine	effective	against	covid
vaccines	have	been	around	for	long	time	and	nearly	everyone	has	been	vaccinated	at	one	time	or	another
but	do	you	know	what	vaccine	actually	is
are	they	type	of	drug
how	are	they	created
today	we	will	get	to	know	more	about	vaccines	and	the	hope	of	conquering	covid	and	other	diseases
what	is	vaccine
unlike	medicine	vaccines	contain	the	same	pathogens	disease	causing	agents	that	cause	disease	but	they	have	been	either	killed	or	weakened	to	the	point	that	they	dont	make	you	sick
these	weakened	pathogens	are	injected	into	our	bodies	to	stimulate	our	immune	system	into	producing	antibodies	that	will	fight	the	targeted	disease
it	may	take	weeks	or	months	for	our	bodies	to	develop	immunity
history	of	vaccines	pathogens	have	been	used	to	prevent	disease	for	over	thousand	years
however	it	was	only	few	hundred	years	ago	that	humans	began	to	grasp	the	biological	concepts	underpinning	this	method
edward	anthony	jenner	doctor	working	in	rural	england	is	widely	regarded	as	the	father	of	vaccines
most	of	his	patients	were	farmers	working	on	cattle	farms
smallpox	outbreak	in	was	killing	lot	of	people
jenner	observed	that	farm	workers	infected	with	cowpox	came	down	with	less	serious	symptoms	than	those	infected	with	smallpox	he	also	observed	that	people	who	had	cowpox	were	not	infected	with	human	smallpox
based	on	his	assumption	that	patients	with	cowpox	were	resistant	to	human	smallpox	he	inoculated	calf	lymph	into	the	wound	of	child	with	smallpox
the	child	developed	low	fever	but	soon	recovered
he	repeated	the	experiment	with	human	smallpox	and	the	boy	was	free	of	the	disease
his	theory	was	validated	and	he	called	this	process	vaccination
the	termvaccineis	derived	from	the	latin	word	for	cow	reflecting	the	origins	of	smallpox	vaccination
jenner	experiment	demonstrated	that	when	person	contracted	cowpox	that	could	be	transmitted	to	humans	the	effects	were	not	as	extreme	as	those	caused	by	human	to	human	smallpox
through	vaccination	the	human	bodys	immune	system	was	developed	to	combat	and	kill	similar	pathogens	in	our	bodies
history	of	vaccine	use	in	thailand	vaccines	were	first	used	to	prevent	disease	in	thailand	during	king	rama	iii	rule
in	there	was	an	outbreak	of	smallpox	in	the	nation
his	majesty	king	rama	iii	instructed	royal	doctors	to	apply	lymph	from	infected	people	to	healthy	people	in	the	same	manner	as	it	was	done	in	china	and	india
the	procedure	however	was	not	successful
meanwhile	after	losing	his	daughter	to	smallpox	american	missionary	dr	dan	beach	bradley	who	had	been	in	the	city	since	was	determined	to	find	way	to	protect	the	thai	people	from	smallpox
in	he	worked	with	royal	doctors	to	successfully	culture	lymph	from	infected	patients	and	used	it	to	inoculate	healthy	patients
in	king	rama	iii	gave	orders	to	procure	the	vaccine	from	the	united	states	to	inoculate	royal	court	officials	and	ordinary	people
types	of	vaccines	vaccines	can	be	divided	into	three	categories	toxoidvaccines	toxoid	vaccinesuse	toxin	made	by	the	pathogen	that	causes	disease	to	induce	immunity	meaning	that	the	immune	response	is	targeted	to	the	toxin	instead	of	the	pathogen
examples	of	this	include	diphtheria	or	tetanus	vaccines
live	attenuated	vaccines	live	vaccines	use	weakened	or	attenuated	form	of	the	pathogen	that	causes	disease	to	stimulate	antibodies	as	used	in	measles	mumps	rubella	chickenpox	shingles	and	japanese	encephalitis	je	vaccines
killed	vaccines	these	are	vaccines	made	in	whole	or	part	from	pathogen	such	as	virus	particles	bacteria	or	other	pathogens	that	have	been	inactivated	or	killed	as	used	in	vaccines	for	hepatitis	and	pertussis	influenza	and	polio
vaccine	production	vaccine	production	involves	several	stages	starting	from	generation	of	the	antigen	from	microbes
microbes	will	be	grown	either	on	primary	cells	such	as	chicken	eggs	for	influenza	or	on	cell	lines	or	cultured	human	cells	for	hepatitis
bacteria	against	which	the	vaccines	are	developed	may	be	grown	in	bioreactors	such	as	for	haemophilus	influenzae	type	after	the	antigen	has	been	formed	it	will	be	separated	from	the	cells	used	in	its	formation	which	in	some	cases	may	require	further	purification	process	finally	the	vaccine	will	be	produced	by	adding	various	substances	such	as	adjuvants	stabilizers	and	preservatives
adjuvants	enhance	the	immune	response	time	of	the	antigen	stabilizers	give	the	vaccine	longer	storage	life	when	combined	with	preservatives
the	addition	of	such	substances	to	vaccines	requires	standardization	because	there	may	be	residues	from	the	manufacturing	process	such	as	antibiotics	egg	proteins	or	yeast	proteins
even	in	small	quantities	residues	can	cause	an	allergic	reaction	so	these	substances	must	be	completely	eliminated	in	the	production	process
it	is	difficult	to	develop	and	produce	combination	vaccines	due	to	the	possibility	of	and	interactions	among	theantigensand	other	ingredients	of	the	vaccines
based	on	the	above	information	the	production	of	vaccine	is	not	an	easy	task	and	requires	several	stages	of	research	and	development	to	obtain	vaccine	that	is	effective	and	will	not	cause	allergic	reactions
more	advanced	technologies	should	help	increase	the	efficacy	of	the	covid	vaccines
with	or	without	the	vaccines	everyone	should	protect	themselves	and	work	to	maintain	their	health	which	can	also	prevent	other	infections	such	as	dengue	fever	that	is	also	deadly
to	increase	your	peace	of	mind	having	health	insurance	is	great	option	to	tackle	the	uncertainty	of	life	and	to	ensure	that	you	have	enough	money	to	cover	your	medical	bills

when	the	transfer	is	completed	there	will	be	transfer	slip	to	be	kept	as	evidence	automatically
some	people	use	it	to	save	money	for	their	children
some	people	can	use	it	to	transfer	money	into	their	savings	accounts	and	their	own	investments	as	well
this	multiple	transfer	feature	is	easy	to	use	and	can	create	multiple	transfer	groups
and	in	one	group	can	add	up	to	payees
the	process	is	not	complicated
you	can	follow	the	instructions	displayed	in	the	scb	easy	app	straight	away
how	to	use	the	multiple	transfer	feature	creating	this	payee	group	first	created	only	once
from	then	if	wanting	to	add	decrease	groups	or	people	in	the	group	can	do	as	needed	how	to	create	payee	group	how	to	transfer	multiple	items	after	the	transfer	group	has	been	created	successfully	if	wanting	to	transfer	money	just	go	to	the	menu	transfer	multiple	items	and	click	the	name	of	the	group	that	we	created
then	choose	our	account	that	you	want	to	use	to	transfer	money
then	scroll	down	the	screen	to	check	the	accuracy	of	the	amount	and	the	number	of	accounts	that	you	want	to	transfer	again
if	wanting	to	edit	someone	balance	you	can	type	and	edit
when	corrected	the	system	will	recalculate	the	total	amount	of	the	group	transfer
when	finished	press
check	information
if	everything	is	correct	you	can	click	to	transfer	money	to	everyone	in	the	group
when	corrected	the	system	will	recalculate	the	total	amount	of	the	group	transfer
when	finished	press
check	information
if	everything	is	correct	you	can	click	to	transfer	money	to	everyone	in	the	group
with	just	this	money	can	be	transferred	to	everyone	in	the	group	instantly
money	transfer	slips	are	automatically	saved	in	the	device	stock	photo	gallery	just	like	general	money	transfers
but	the	slip	will	be	longer	because	there	are	greater	number	of	destination	accounts	anyone	who	wants	to	try	this	feature	may	start	by	setting	up	group	to	transfer	money	in	the	family	such	as	setting	up	money	to	transfer	money	to	the	account	of	parents	while	also	transferring	money	into	their	own	accounts	every	month	it	not	chic	try	it	and	you	ll	be	hooked
sometimes	small	things	can	cause	us	more	problems	than	we	think
or	being	too	good	may	bring	danger	to	yourself	as	well
like	money	matters	suddenly	there	are	people	who	transfer	the	wrong	money	into	our	account
which	seems	to	be	nothing	who	sent	the	wrong	money
we	then	transfer	the	money	back
but	if	we	and	the	account	owner	are	well	known	such	as	close	friend	or	family	member	can	be	transferred	back	to	each	other	nothing	wrong
but	if	we	do	not	know	the	transferor	or	may	know	only	superficial	such	as	from	online	shopping	in	hurry	to	transfer	the	money	back
the	conclusion	of	the	story	may	not	end	as	you	think
the	matter	of	the	story	is	the	wrong	money	transfer	maybe	due	to	the	intent	of	frauds	such	as	those	who	transfer	money	wrongly	may	order	illegal	goods
therefore	avoid	being	checked	for	money	transfer	routes	by	transferring	to	someone	account	instead
in	this	case	if	we	transfer	money	back	may	also	be	considered	an	offender	as	well
therefore	when	someone	who	does	not	know	contact	that	there	is	wrong	transfer	in	to	our	account	do	not	hurry	to	ask	for	the	account	number	in	order	to	transfer	the	money	back
but	notice	that	the	person	will	mainly	contact	us	to	provide	details	of	the	wrong	transfer	or	contact	to	request	personal	information	from	us
and	expedited	us	to	transfer	money	back	right	away	which	if	it	is	true	money	transfer	those	who	call	us	should	be	officers	from	the	bank
and	we	must	not	rush	us	to	transfer	the	money	back
when	receiving	wrong	transfer	transaction	to	our	account	what	the	contact	must	notify	us	is	contact	from	which	bank
what	is	wrong	with	the	transaction	when	during	which	period	and	how	much	is	it
and	how	is	the	transaction	made
importantly	once	we	have	finished	talking	ask	for	the	name	surname	and	the	contact	number	of	the	person	who	called	us
then	ask	for	time	to	check	first	whether	the	wrong	account	has	been	transferred	according	to	the	information	reported
after	hanging	up	please	check	our	account	first	to	see	if	there	is	any	transfer	as	reported
if	you	have	internet	banking	or	mobile	banking	you	can	go	to	check	the	transaction	straight	away
but	if	there	isn	may	ask	the	bank	call	center	to	check	the	money	transfer
if	verified	the	wrong	account	is	transferred
the	bank	will	contact	us	to	allow	the	bank	to	take	the	money	back	to	the	source	account
which	we	do	not	need	to	transfer	by	ourselves	which	the	bank	will	report	the	transaction	results	to	us	to	keep	as	evidence	but	if	we	ignore	the	refund	may	be	prosecuted	for	fraud	of	property	other	than	their	own	will	for	those	who	are	worried	that	one	day	may	be	called	to	transfer	money	from	criminals
for	safety	we	can	also	report	to	the	police	station	to	record	in	another	way	as	well
at	least	there	is	evidence	that	comes	to	our	innocence
in	summary	this	matter	is	prudent
money	is	not	ours	when	someone	wrongly	transferred	must	find	correct	management	method	so	that	it	will	not	be	in	trouble	later
then	check	the	information	before	transferring	successfully	so	you	don	have	to	waste	time	following	and	asking
the	mask	now	is	rare	item
if	there	is	shop	where	you	must	line	up	in	order	to	be	the	owner	even	if	only	couple	of	pieces	must	do
but	finally	if	used	for	while	or	with	heavy	use	which	is	in	an	infected	area	for	example	in	the	hospital	for	more	than	hours	should	be	discarded	immediately
but	the	used	mask	is	not	blindly	discarded	because	it	may	become	means	of	transmitting	the	infection	to	other	people	therefore	there	is	way	to	dispose	of	used	masks	correctly	according	to	the	recommendations	of	the	department	of	health
ministry	of	public	health	together
how	to	wash	cloth	mask	since	face	masks	are	rare	item	currently	many	people	must	use	cloth	masks
although	the	efficiency	of	the	cloth	mask	is	less	than	other	types	of	masks	the	data	from	the	department	of	health	the	ministry	of	public	health	states	that	people	in	general	are	physically	fit	no	illness	can	wear	cloth	masks	instead	of	sanitary	masks
wash	the	fabric	mask	properly	during	these	crises	discipline	and	responsibility	for	both	ourselves	and	society	are	important
even	small	negligence	can	have	broader	impact	on	society
therefore	careful	and	correct	practice	is	another	way	to	help	us	get	through	this	crisis	together	faster
disease	and	illness	are	something	that	can	always	happen	to	anyone	for	peace	of	mind	that	we	will	have	enough	money	to	cope	with	the	more	expensive	medical	expenses	every	day
health	insurance	is	therefore	prudent	way	to	deal	with	the	uncertainty	that	may	occur	in	the	future

while	lot	of	people	have	tried	to	prevent	them	from	becoming	infected	with	covid	there	are	several	unfortunate	people	who	have	been	infected	but	in	the	end	good	luck	until	the	illness	disappeared
but	there	are	still	many	questions	about	people	who	have	been	infected	that	many	people	still	suspect
both	those	who	have	been	sick	themselves	and	those	around	them	may	still	be	worried	and	afraid	that	those	who	have	already	said	that	they	have	recovered	will	be	safe	with	those	around	them	or	not
or	can	spread	the	infection	further	people	who	have	been	sick	have	questions	about	whether	they	can	get	back	again	or	not
how	should	they	act
when	will	you	be	able	to	return	to	normal	life
as	of	today	medical	research	has	not	been	confirmed	yet	but	there	are	some	studies	on	this	subject	as	follows	if	we	dont	have	fever	or	have	no	symptoms	are	we	still	infected
there	is	high	possibility	that	those	who	have	fever	or	without	symptoms	will	still	have	the	infection	in	the	body
this	is	something	that	needs	to	be	studied	for	while
but	little	research	data	from	germany	found	that	the	covid	infection	for	the	first	days	patients	recovering	symptoms	are	not	severe
found	that	the	infection	in	the	body	is	lower	than	when	the	infection	was	first	detected
while	some	patients	appear	to	have	improved	symptoms	but	after	returning	to	get	sick	again
dr	chris	gough	the	anesthetist	from	oxford	england	is	twitter	publisher	about	the	terrifying	symptoms	that	day	the	sick	person	feels	better
but	after	that	he	could	sleep	on	the	sofa	for	an	hour	until	not	wanting	to	leave	the	house	which	means	that	the	symptoms	can	swing	back	and	forth
while	experts	belonging	to	wuhan	hospital	said	that	the	virus	will	remain	in	the	body	of	those	who	have	disappeared	for	another	two	weeks
after	that	if	the	patient	does	not	have	cough	or	sneezing	that	is	considered	characteristic	of	transmission	it	may	mean	that	it	cannot	be	transmitted	again
but	recent	study	published	in	the	lancet	medical	journal	states	that	chinese	patient	who	has	been	infected	for	days	is	higher	than	the	average	of	the	disease	which	is	days
therefore	it	is	still	not	possible
clearly	tell	if	people	who	appear	to	have	normal	symptoms	still	have	the	infection	in	the	body	or	not
if	it	has	caught	covid	can	it	be	repeated
when	infected	with	covid	and	it	gone	and	completely	healed	meaning	the	body	can	build	immunity	to	fight	for	while	or	built	continuously
however	recurrent	infections	were	found	in	year	old	japanese	woman	licensed	from	osaka	hospital	to	go	home
and	found	the	case	of	the	passenger	of	diamond	princess	and	another	south	korean	citizen
but	the	worry	is	of	cases	of	patients	returning	for	the	treatment	of	covid	in	guangdong	province	china
however	it	is	not	clear	whether	the	infection	will	be	repeated
because	didn	check	and	confirmation	or	even	may	have	an	error	in	the	examination
or	it	may	be	because	the	virus	stopped	working	for	moment	and	hasn	really	disappeared
the	united	states	center	for	disease	control	and	prevention	cdc	is	still	unable	to	clearly	summarize
which	must	be	studied	further
as	for	other	health	effects	it	was	observed	that	the	patients	covid	will	have	reduced	lung	capacity	and	hospitals	in	hong	kong	found	that	two	thirds	of	patients	have	reduced	lung	function	by	but	some	can	be	treated	with	physical	therapy
once	healed	how	long	does	the	immune	covid	last
if	general	infection	the	body	is	immune	to	the	virus
dr	keiji	fukuda	director	of	the	hong	kong	medical	school	said	in	the	la	time	if	you	must	repeatedly	become	infected	it	is	abnormal
except	that	the	function	of	the	human	immune	system	is	not	working	properly
but	for	covid	the	answer	is	still	very	vague
someone	tried	to	answer	this	question	by	analyzing	the	sars	cov	serum	and	covid	disease
but	that	still	does	not	specify	much
because	there	has	not	been	any	human	testing	yet
but	in	general	if	the	illness	is	recovered	the	body	will	build	immunity	from	returning	to	the	disease	like	measles
or	chickenpox	the	use	of	plasma	recovered	from	patients	in	the	treatment	of	covid	dr	yong	phuworawan	head	of	clinical	virology	specialization	center	faculty	of	medicine	chulalongkorn	university	post	the	importance	of	plasma
with	content	as	follows	the	use	of	plasma	or	lymph	of	the	person	who	recovered	from	the	disease	to	treat	patients	with	severe	symptoms	from	the	same	infection
has	been	done	for	long	time
in	the	outbreak	of	new	diseases	such	as	the	era	of	sars	mers	ebola
and	likewise	it	has	been	used	to	treat	critically	ill	covid	diseases	in	china
there	are	reports	in	journals	that	are	known	to	be	effective	in	treatment	such	as	in	the	journal	of	chest	jama	etc
therefore	in	the	plasma	collection	process	volunteers	who	have	been	infected	with	covid	said	that	while	donations	were	not	found	in	the	blood
and	from	the	neck	tag	including	the	immunity	measurement	against	cattle	completely	recovered	from	the	said	ailment
by	following	the	standards	of	the	us	cdc	with	an	immunity	level	greater	than	or	equal	to	in	this	project	the	national	blood	center	will	be	mainstay	in	cooperation	with	the	center	for	clinical	virology
faculty	of	medicine	chulalongkorn	university	and	mahidol	university
the	resulting	plasma	will	be	quality	plasma	that	can	be	used	to	treat	covid
therefore	people	who	are	infected	or	ill	from	covid	disease	are	invited	and	registered	to	receive	screening	test
at	the	national	blood	center	to	donate	plasma
in	which	the	plasma	is	stored	to	be	used	as	cure	for	covid	donors	must	be	person	who	has	been	discharged	from	the	hospital	and	has	been	certified	as	well	have	healthy	body	for	at	least	days	after	leaving	the	hospital	no	vaccine	was	detected	from	the	neck	and	in	the	blood
age	between	and	years	and	weighing	over	kilograms
if	the	symptoms	are	normal	then	when	can	return	to	normal	life	the	last	thing	the	world	wants	to	know	is	if	we	have	disease	from	covid	and	all	symptoms	returned	to	normal	and	then	returned	to	work	when	can	you	return	to	normal	life
the	united	states	center	for	disease	control	and	prevention	cdc	has	determined	that	patients	can	leave	the	hospital	and	return	to	normal	life	when	note	swab	test	is	test	using	cotton	swab	to	sweep	the	secretions	of	patients	according	to	the	doctor	diagnosis
therefore	before	returning	to	normal	life	all	these	tests	must	be	recovered	and	ready	to	return	to	work	which	must	be	followed	only	by	doctor	order
in	practice	many	governments	and	companies	continue	to	work	at	home	or	continue	detention	for	at	least	days
most	patients	infected	with	covid	will	be	able	to	recover	completely	to	normal	however	those	who	are	ill	having	to	be	careful	to	show	responsibility	to	society	as	well
references	your	lifesaver	move	with	confidence

there	is	city	shut	down	to	prevent	the	spread	of	the	disease
the	airport	is	lonely	tourist	attractions	almost	deserted	people	many	businesses	are	directly	and	indirectly	affected
until	having	to	reduce	staff	lay	off	or	shut	down
people	don	need	to	go	out
do	not	dare	to	be	in	crowded	place	and	keep	up	with	the	news	to	update	the	spread	of	this	virus	the	information	received	was	mixed	and	fake
or	some	information	that	we	have	previously	held	as	guidelines	for	preventing	infection	may	have	to	adjust	to	the	situation	depending
for	example	by	using	spoon	in	the	middle	of	spoon	to	scoop	food	there	is	risk	of	infection	from	touching	the	spoons	together
must	change	to	eat	hot	spoon	it	and	always	wash	your	hands	thoroughly
but	if	looking	optimistic	the	widespread	outbreak	of	covid	has	made	people	around	the	world	realize	the	importance	of	taking	care	of	themselves	farther	from	various	diseases
including	the	government	and	business	sectors	are	aware	of	the	need	to	adjust	and	adapt	to	achieve	sustainability	proactively
to	reduce	the	risk	of	the	spread	of	various	pathogens	in	the	future	more
like	taiwan	even	though	it	close	to	china	there	are	millions	of	citizens	working	in	china
including	tourists	from	china	traveling	to	taiwan	not	less	making	taiwan	country	with	high	risk	of	finding	covid	patients	in	the	world
but	it	turns	out	that	taiwan	has	very	low	prevalence	compared	to	many	countries	around	the	world
that	because	of	the	outbreak	of	sars
the	taiwanese	government	has	established	the	national	health	center	nhcc	as	part	of	disaster	management	center	that	focuses	on	proactive	response	to	the	outbreak
by	using	the	national	health	insurance	database	integrate	with	the	immigration	and	customs	database	to	create	big	data	to	analyze	alert	and	prevent	the	epidemic	effectively
taiwan	therefore	quickly	cope	with	the	outbreak	of	covid
covid	even	though	the	disease	is	mild	to	the	point	of	death	and	everyone	died
but	spread	quickly	and	widely	causing	widespread	paranoia	many	things	slow	to	the	stage	of	disruption	but	on	the	other	hand	it	encourages	adjustments	to	be	more	options	for	survival	such	as	in	every	crisis	there	are	always	hidden	opportunities

ready	to	buy	today	at	scb	branches
when	we	are	going	to	summer	the	air	conditioner	is	indispensable	out	of	the	air	conditioned	room	noiselessly	hot
sweaty	and	swollen	irritated	and	incoherent	but	will	turn	on	the	air	conditioning	to	cool	and	feel	comfortable	afraid	to	be	shocked	by	the	bill	of	electricity	bills	that	rise	as	the	temperature	suggesting	how	to	turn	on	the	air	conditioner	to	save	money	on	electricity	bills	this	summer
clean	the	air	the	first	method	is	to	clean	the	air
because	when	the	air	conditioner	is	in	use	for	long	time	there	will	be	dust	and	dirt	entering	the	air	conditioner
and	as	more	and	more	accumulate	it	will	make	the	air	conditioner	not	cold	work	harder	use	more	power	than	before	and	if	dust	gets	clogged	into	the	air	duct	it	will	cause	the	air	to	drip	initial	cleaning	of	the	air	by	cleaning	the	coarse	filter	can	help	the	air	to	work	better
or	let	the	air	conditioners	clean	and	freshly	make	the	air	conditioner	to	work	at	full	efficiency	set	the	temperature	slightly	above	degrees	there	is	an	understanding	that	the	air	temperature	of	degrees	is	the	most	economical	temperature	which	is	slight
in	fact	the	temperature	is	degrees	the	temperature	that	the	body	feels	most	comfortable
therefore	it	is	recommended	to	set	the	air	temperature	to	degrees	but	if	anyone	tries	to	increase	the	temperature	to	degrees	and	still	feel	comfortable	suggest	slightly	raise	the	temperature	the	air	conditioner	will	work	less
helps	to	save	energy	and	save	on	electricity	bills
if	really	hot	during	the	day	maybe	try	to	adjust	the	temperature	only	at	night	when	the	weather	is	less	hot
then	set	the	time	to	turn	off	the	air	hour	before	waking	up
this	will	help	save	electricity	bills
avoid	using	the	air	conditioner	in	the	open	space	the	open	air	in	an	open	room	like	the	hall	which	has	stairs	walkway	to	other	rooms	no	barrier	in	addition	to	the	air	is	not	cold
also	causes	the	air	conditioner	to	work	harder	than	usual	and	the	electricity	bill	also	increases	therefore	should	turn	on	the	air	conditioner	in	closed	space	room	or	if	really	need	to	use	the	air	conditioner	in	the	hallway	then	should	install	partition	to	open	and	close	blocking	the	stairs	and	passages	to	other	rooms	including	closing	the	window	neat	curtain	which	the	curtain	helps	to	reduce	the	temperature	from	outside	sunlight	air	conditioner	works	less
save	energy	and	electricity	bills	use	fan	to	help	turning	on	the	ventilator	in	the	room	before	turning	on	the	air	conditioner	will	help	reduce	the	heat	temperature	in	the	room
causing	the	air	conditioner	not	to	work	very	hard	when	turning	on	especially	if	turning	on	the	fan	helps	while	turning	on	the	air	conditioner	to	help	cool	the	air	from	the	air	spread	throughout	the	room	and	even	if	adjusting	the	temperature	to	degrees	according	to	item	turning	on	the	fan	will	help	keep	the	air	cool	as	before	more	is	saving	energy	than	before	avoid	bringing	hot	humid	things	into	the	room
normally	bringing	hot	items	into	the	room	will	make	the	air	conditioner	work	harder	to	reduce	the	rising	heat	in	the	room
many	people	would	not	think	that	having	tree	wet	clothes	liquid	water	container	in	the	room	causing	the	air	conditioner	to	work	harder	affect	the	increased	electricity	bill	as	well	because	the	working	principle	of	the	air	conditioner	in	addition	to	using	of	energy	to	reduce	room	temperature	also	uses	of	energy	to	get	rid	of	humidity	allowing	the	air	to	dry	in	the	room	therefore	having	moisture	in	the	room	causing	the	air	conditioner	to	use	hard	work	energy	to	get	rid	of	moisture	in	the	room	avoiding	bringing	moisture	and	hot	items	into	the	room	helps	to	save	energy
another	way	to	reduce	electricity	bills	normally	bringing	hot	items	into	the	room	will	make	the	air	conditioner	work	harder	to	reduce	the	rising	heat	in	the	room
