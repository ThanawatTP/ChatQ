the	food	and	beverage	industry	has	been	severely	affected	by	the	covid	pandemic	forcing	many	business	operators	to	quit
some	players	have	adapted	to	home	delivery	even	though	it	does	not	guarantee	success	for	everyone
what	are	key	factors	behind	the	skyrocketing	sales	and	revenues	of	restaurants	opting	for	home	delivery	channels
the	scb	sme	robinhood	food	delivery	platform	invited	khun	chonlawit	trailoka	the	owner	of	kapong	delivery	restaurant	and	khun	boontham	pakpho	the	iron	chef	of	japanese	restaurant	honmono	sushi	to	share	their	tips	for	hot	selling	in	an	online	seminar	entitled	secret	recipes	and	survival	strategies	for	the	industry	entering	the	industry	competition	khun	boontham	began	his	food	career	as	chef	at	famous	hotel
long	experience	brought	him	the	idea	of	running	trading	business	as	limited	partnership	which	soon	yielded	revenues	higher	than	his	previous	salary
then	he	decided	to	quit	his	chef	position	to	dedicate	himself	to	his	new	business
however	some	regular	clients	complained	because	they	missed	his	food	so	he	decided	to	establish	the	honmono	sushi	restaurant	in	partnership	with	his	friends
the	restaurant	has	eight	locations	as	of	now
khun	chonlawit	saw	business	opportunity	during	the	pandemic
he	noticed	that	running	restaurant	nowadays	doesnt	require	shopfront	or	good	location
if	you	are	equipped	with	cloud	kitchen	and	use	online	marketing	strategies	it	can	work	and	lead	to	success
previously	khun	chonlawit	had	marketing	business	in	myanmar	and	opened	thai	restaurant	there
due	to	the	pandemic	he	decided	to	close	the	restaurant	and	returned	to	thailand
being	an	active	person	and	seeing	an	opportunity	in	the	fact	that	no	restaurant	offered	deep	fried	seabass	with	fish	sauce	glaze	on	their	delivery	menu	he	decided	to	open	kapong	seabass	in	thai	to	be	the	first	to	offer	the	popular	dish	through	delivery
after	gaining	popularity	other	seabass	dishes	were	added	to	the	menu
he	saw	an	opportunity	amid	the	crisis	with	clear	branding	through	online	marketing	restaurant	focusing	on	seabass	dishes	only
as	result	customers	remember	and	recognize	the	restaurant	which	has	quickly	gained	popularity
how	to	boost	orders	for	food	delivery	sales	khun	boontham	said	that	during	the	first	wave	of	covid	his	food	delivery	experience	was	zero	but	he	tried	to	compete	by	registering	with	every	food	delivery	platform	available
but	the	response	was	not	as	good	as	he	expected
so	he	adjusted	his	strategy	to	opt	for	facebook	marketing
he	highlighted	the	restaurants	strength	in	sourcing	premium	ingredients	through	live	sales	sessions	offering	ingredient	bidding	starting	from	baht	to	attract	customers
through	such	live	sessions	he	talks	with	customers	and	gains	insights	to	weather	the	crisis	with	higher	number	of	orders
khun	chonlawit	opened	his	restaurant	during	the	crisis	with	different	strategy	no	shopfront	just	cloud	kitchen	and	online	marketing
his	kapong	restaurant	offers	dishes	at	affordable	prices	and	with	quality	ingredients
his	branding	strategy	is	to	focus	on	seabass	as	the	selling	point	and	create	variety	of	dishes	and	flavors	with	interesting	dish	names	to	offer	fun	dining	experience
the	restaurant	has	its	own	team	of	riders	to	reduce	issues	with	food	looking	less	appetizing	than	when	dining	in	and	for	more	control	over	delivery	costs
kapong	is	also	available	on	the	robinhood	food	delivery	platform	thanks	to	its	no	gross	profit	gp	fees	enabling	wider	customer	reach
strategies	to	weather	the	covid	crisis	khun	boontham	noted	that	while	shopping	malls	have	been	closed	during	the	pandemic	their	costs	remain	the	same	even	with	delivery	as	an	option
so	only	the	thong	lor	honmono	sushi	branch	remains	open
the	menu	has	been	adjusted	to	better	suit	food	delivery	and	some	kitchen	staff	has	been	re	assigned	to	deliver	food
at	first	customers	were	responsible	for	delivery	fees	and	sales	figures	were	stagnant
then	he	tried	free	delivery	promotion	for	the	first	five	kilometers
this	hurts	the	business	badly	because	his	food	prices	were	already	cheap
next	he	tried	readjusting	with	free	delivery	within	kilometers	strategy	for	minimum	order	of	baht
this	was	game	changer
its	win	win	for	both	the	restaurant	and	customers
this	is	an	example	of	learning	by	doing	adjusting	strategy	to	suit	the	current	situation	for	successful	online	sales
khun	chonlawit	started	his	business	during	the	early	phase	of	the	crisis
he	was	aware	of	potential	issues	and	sought	preventive	solutions	to	weather	the	previous	waves	unscathed
however	the	recent	wave	has	entailed	impacts
now	he	employs	team	of	riders	instead	of	using	his	personal	car	for	food	delivery
having	his	own	riders	allows	him	to	calculate	appropriate	delivery	fees	and	better	control	costs
he	also	develops	attractive	promotions	to	boost	sales	figures	such	as	set	menu	for	baht	and	delivery	fee	discounts	so	customers	can	make	easier	purchasing	decisions
difference	between	selling	online	and	offline	in	khun	chonlawits	opinion	online	channels	help	save	costs	involved	in	rental	decorations	restaurant	supplies	and	much	more
but	you	need	to	focus	more	on	social	media	marketing	such	as	facebook
the	look	of	your	facebook	page	is	very	important
to	attract	followers	and	motivate	orders	it	needs	to	be	eye	catching	and	outstanding	with	interesting	photos	and	stories
khun	boontham	thinks	that	its	easier	to	reach	customers	via	offline	channels	because	you	need	to	make	double	or	triple	the	effort	for	online	channels	to	boost	recognition	among	customers
your	facebook	page	always	needs	to	be	up	to	date
line	official	account	is	equally	important	for	honmono	sushi	because	it	is	their	only	channel	for	food	orders
khun	boontham	said	that	while	facebook	is	like	the	restaurants	window	that	needs	to	look	attractive	and	stay	active	all	the	time	line	is	like	the	backbone	used	to	close	deals
this	is	because	despite	having	hundreds	of	thousand	of	facebook	followers	reach	is	very	low	if	you	dont	buy	ads
on	the	other	hand	your	news	and	promotions	can	easily	reach	tens	of	thousands	of	line	followers
thats	why	his	restaurant	accepts	orders	via	line	only
just	of	sales	via	line	can	help	boost	sales	figures
so	his	restaurant	focuses	on	the	line	app	as	the	key	channel
tip	to	motivate	people	to	add	restaurant	as	their	line	friend	is	to	offer	promotions	at	cheap	prices
when	they	are	interested	they	need	to	add	you	as	line	friend	to	order	food
strategies	to	effectively	attract	online	customers	khun	chonlawit	said	that	his	restaurants	focus	is	seabass	dishes	and	the	main	customer	group	is	those	in	their	who	are	not	that	familiar	with	the	technology
therefore	he	offers	channels	for	placing	orders	via	phone	calls	traditional	method	and	social	media	including	facebooks	messenger	inbox	and	line	chats
he	emphasizes	customer	satisfaction	and	word	of	mouth	marketing
as	for	problem	solving	good	example	is	that	in	cases	of	wrong	dish	delivery	or	missing	item	the	restaurant	will	have	rider	deliver	it	immediately	to	maintain	customer	satisfaction	as	priority	before	thinking	of	profitability
khun	boontham	pays	attention	to	his	customers	requirements	and	preferences	always	trying	to	meet	their	requirements	if	possible
if	someone	comments	not	bad	about	dish	he	prepared	new	dish	will	replace	it	immediately	because	every	dish	from	his	restaurant	must	be	the	very	best
long	term	strategies	to	cope	with	covid	challenges	while	the	end	of	the	covid	pandemic	is	still	uncertain	khun	boontham	recommends	restaurants	have	their	own	platform	to	directly	handle	customers	and	orders	and	to	cope	with	potential	risks
restaurant	operators	should	find	new	ideas	to	boost	sales	such	as	offering	frozen	or	ready	to	eat	meals
as	for	khun	chonlawit	his	long	term	plan	is	to	have	more	locations	and	franchising	with	no	shopfronts	using	only	cloud	or	home	kitchen	and	the	same	online	shopfront	system	as	the	parent	company
he	is	hopeful	that	this	type	of	business	model	will	help	cope	with	the	crisis	in	the	long	run
he	would	like	to	cheer	up	industry	peers	and	encourage	them	not	to	give	up
do	what	you	love	and	you	will	be	successful	the	hands	on	experience	of	these	real	online	market	players	shows	that	you	must	adapt	to	situations	keep	learning	and	continue	self	development	to	survive	the	crisis
dont	be	discouraged	or	faint	hearted
keep	finding	new	ideas	and	innovations	and	you	will	see	survival	opportunities

when	entering	chinese	market	you	may	be	familiar	with	city	tier	or	hierarchical	classification	of	chinese	cities	which	is	the	first	factor	to	study	before	entering	chinese	market
most	entrepreneurs	misunderstand	that	all	cities	in	china	are	the	same
in	fact	china	has	vast	land	area	and	each	city	has	great	diversity	in	size	purchasing	power	and	peoples	taste	and	demand
before	running	business	in	china	you	should	know	who	you	want	to	sell	products	to	and	where	to	launch	your	products
you	can	make	primary	consideration	from	city	tier	information	to	get	an	insight	into	the	market
what	would	city	tier	consider
city	tier	classification	is	not	official	information	from	the	government	but	from	an	analysis	of	reliable	media	such	as	yicai	global	south	china	morning	post	mafengwo	report	by	gathering	all	dimensions	of	information	comprising	land	size	population	number	infrastructure	readiness	transportation	network	high	speed	rail	airport	etc	peoples	lifestyle	business	opportunity	including	big	data
here	are	examples	under	criteria	of	yicai	global	in	commercial	resources	index	for	example	the	number	of	stores	that	sell	brand	products	an	increasing	number	of	brand	stores	the	number	of	customers	entering	the	store	the	number	of	online	stores	the	number	of	restaurants	clothes	and	supermarkets
city	as	hub	index	considering	transportation	network	between	the	cities	such	as	access	to	high	rapid	rail	the	number	of	stations	the	frequency	of	rail	routes	the	number	of	airports	the	number	of	domestic	and	international	flights	and	product	distribution	centers	etc
urban	residents	activity	index	measuring	by	citizen	consumption	such	as	online	shopping	the	use	of	tencent	social	network	the	use	of	electronic	tools	the	use	of	tiktok	nightlife	activities	like	pub	and	bar	hangouts	livehouse	going	to	the	cinema	at	night	and	night	transportation	routes
lifestyle	diversity	index	measuring	by	variety	of	restaurants	museums	sports	matches	caf	bookstores	cinemas	live	performances	proceeds	from	purchasing	books	via	jd	com	shopping	on	taobao	travel	information	on	mafengwo	com	etc
future	potential	index	for	example	the	number	of	startups	platforms	the	number	of	fundraising	the	number	of	high	quality	local	companies	air	quality	labor	hiring	the	quality	of	students	gdp	numbers	the	number	of	permanent	residents	the	growth	rate	of	permanent	residents	the	number	of	foreign	workers	etc
even	though	city	tier	is	not	official	information	but	most	foreign	investors	use	that	data	as	reference	when	considering	the	strategic	plan	in	running	business	in	china
how	many	levels	are	in	city	tier
the	city	tier	is	classified	into	levels
first	beijing	shanghai	guangzhou	and	shenzhen
those	are	the	most	developed	cities	in	economics	and	infrastructures	as	people	have	high	purchasing	power
all	are	large	cities	that	have	political	and	cultural	influence	over	the	country
new	first	tier	cities	chengdu	hangzhou	chongqing	wuhan	xian	suzhou	tianjin	nanjing	changsha	zhengzhou	dongguan	qingdao	shenyang	hefei	and	foshan
all	are	big	cities	with	high	development	in	economics	and	infrastructures	after	the	first	tier	cities
consumers	also	have	high	purchasing	power
tier	cities	and	most	are	major	county	or	on	the	east	coast	xiamen	fuzhou	wuxi	kunming	harbin	jinan	changchun	wenzhou	shijiazhuang	and	nanning	etc
all	cities	are	not	as	booming	as	the	new	first	tier	cities
tier	cities	depending	on	the	ranking	person	which	are	as	prosperous	as	the	district	level	and	are	considered	economically	developed	cities
select	the	right	city	and	market	to	sell	products	via	cross	border	commerce	ms	pimkwan	aditapsatit	avp	of	scb	china	business	development	expertise	in	china	business	introduced	that	cross	border	commerce	cbec	is	to	export	products	from	thailand	and	sell	on	commerce	platforms	in	china
it	is	an	easy	and	suitable	channel	for	sme	business	which	can	directly	access	to	chinese	consumers
consumers	in	each	city	tier	have	different	needs	about	products	shopping	style	and	platform
for	example	first	tier	cities	prefer	the	worlds	super	luxury	brand	and	shopping	via	tmall	kaola	jd	and	red	while	consumers	in	new	first	tier	cities	love	international	premium	quality	brands	and	shopping	on	social	commerce	like	wechat	and	tiktok
tier	cities	look	for	local	premium	brands	and	shopping	via	mini	program	and	pinduoduo	pdd
finally	tier	cities	are	price	sensitive	admire	local	brands	and	shopping	via	pdd	and	wishing
as	china	market	is	diversified	and	dynamic	entrepreneurs	need	to	study	and	understand	chinese	consumer	behaviors	including	the	city	tier	system	as	one	of	that	market	factors
consequently	entrepreneurs	will	be	able	to	do	market	segmentation	to	find	the	right	customers	for	their	products	select	suitable	cbec	platforms	in	line	with	the	target	group	and	create	an	efficient	market	strategy

homegrown	food	delivery	application	robinhood	catering	to	small	eateries	debuted	just	over	year	ago	and	continues	to	carry	on	its	commitment	to	building	social	enterprise	model
with	this	determination	the	application	has	now	expanded	its	scope	of	services	to	the	tourism	sector	to	assist	thai	entrepreneurs	in	recovering	quickly	after	reopening	the	country
robinhood	travel	is	thai	national	ota	online	travel	agent	combining	all	in	one	travel	experiences	in	one	platform	including	accommodation	booking	services	air	tickets	tours	activities	car	rentals	and	insurance
with	its	zero	commission	stance	the	move	will	relieve	operators	of	the	cost	of	using	online	booking	agents	allowing	them	to	offer	discounts	for	tourists
robinhood	travel	marks	an	important	step	forward	for	the	robinhood	platform	in	its	quest	to	become	homegrown	super	app	ready	for	official	launch	in	early	purple	ventures	co	ltd	chairman	thana	thienachariya	and	managing	director	srihanath	lamsam	will	share	with	us	robinhood	next	step	in	expanding	into	the	tourism	business	and	bringing	normalcy	back	to	travel	in	the	new	normal	post	pandemic	world
from	an	app	for	small	players	to	new	mission	to	help	thai	tourism	and	hospitality	entrepreneurs	launched	with	the	intention	of	creating	platform	to	assist	small	businesses	affected	by	the	covid	situation	particularly	by	helping	small	eateries	avoid	gp	fees	the	platform	received	positive	feedback	from	users	shops	and	delivery	riders	over	the	past	year
now	we	are	turning	our	attention	toward	another	business	being	impacted	by	the	pandemic	the	tourism	industry	which	has	become	the	main	engine	driving	the	thai	economy	since	the	country	reopening
we	asked	ourselves	how	the	robinhood	app	could	help	the	tourism	industry	and	the	goal	of	expanding	the	app	to	support	the	hospitality	and	travel	industries	were	born
when	we	launched	the	robinhood	food	delivery	platform	no	one	believed	we	would	survive	thana	said
how	will	we	compete	with	foreign	platforms
the	intention	to	create	platform	of	kindness	without	gp	fees	has	turned	out	to	be	discovery	of	new	supportive	business	model
we	have	now	taken	the	same	concept	from	food	delivery	and	applied	it	to	the	hotel	industry
we	didn	do	it	sooner	because	people	were	still	concerned	about	traveling	but	this	is	an	excellent	time	to	enter	the	hotel	and	tourism	sector
furthermore	robinhood	has	significant	assets	of	over	million	customers	with	high	purchasing	power	in	bangkok	and	surrounding	areas
almost	half	of	them	are	credit	card	customers	using	mobile	banking	so	it	is	easier	to	persuade	them	to	travel
hotel	businesses	rely	heavily	on	ota	platforms	that	take	commissions
furthermore	larger	hotels	have	more	negotiating	power	and	pay	less	than	smaller	hotels
these	facts	served	as	the	starting	point	for	our	zero	commission	robinhood	travel	model	that	will	play	part	in	assisting	thai	tourism	businesses	in	turning	around	and	moving	forward
good	for	small	and	medium	sized	hotel	businesses	and	for	those	who	want	to	enjoy	seamless	travel	experience
the	robinhood	app	continues	to	be	an	app	for	small	players
today	our	focus	is	on	helping	the	tourism	market	in	thailand	which	is	an	important	segment	of	helping	the	country	revitalize	the	grassroots	economy
at	the	moment	thailand	has	over	small	and	medium	sized	accommodations	featuring	some	rooms
fifty	percent	are	booked	through	otas	which	are	all	owned	by	foreign	enterprises
in	the	pre	covid	period	in	accommodation	booking	by	thais	through	otas	was	worth	total	of	billion	baht	srihanath	said
overall	bookings	through	the	top	two	otas	stood	at	and	for	which	hotels	have	to	pay	commissions
interchain	hotels	will	be	charged	while	smaller	hotels	with	less	negotiating	power	will	be	charged	and	they	must	wait	to	get	paid	in	days
during	the	covid	pandemic	hotels	have	tried	to	get	customers	to	book	directly	through	their	own	channels	such	as	websites	call	centers	or	walk	ins
while	large	hotel	chains	dont	have	any	problem	publicizing	their	websites	it	is	difficult	for	medium	and	small	hotels	to	promote	their	websites	to	large	number	of	customers
this	puts	smaller	hotels	at	significant	disadvantage	srihanath	elaborated
robinhood	travel	travel	was	created	to	alleviate	pain	points	for	hotel	and	tourism	business	operators	by	eliminating	hotel	booking	commissions
it	also	provides	seamless	tailor	made	travel	experience	for	customers	seeking	travel	related	services	such	as	lodging	air	tickets	local	tours	guides	activities	or	car	rentals
it	focuses	on	small	scale	entrepreneurs	in	outlying	provinces	such	as	local	van	operators	or	community	related	leisure	activities
this	will	aid	in	the	distribution	of	income	to	communities
we	hope	that	robinhood	travel	will	pass	on	the	gift	of	kindness	to	operators	who	will	then	return	the	favor	to	customers	who	book	with	us
aside	from	not	charging	commissions	and	letting	hotels	earn	fuller	incomes	hotels	can	choose	whether	to	receive	payments	on	daily	or	hourly	basis
unlike	other	otas	robinhood	travel	offers	flexibility	allowing	hotels	to	manage	price	promotions	or	package	campaigns	by	themselves	in	real	time
further	the	platform	is	willing	to	use	its	media	to	support	entrepreneurs	at	no	cost
this	is	useful	add	on	for	small	and	medium	sized	hotels	enabling	operators	to	use	their	digital	marketing	potential	to	the	fullest	and	acquire	customer	intelligence	for	their	benefit
from	customer	perspective	users	can	enjoy	digital	payments	eliminating	the	risk	of	theft
plus	they	can	opt	for	installation	payments	and	redeem	points	for	hotel	or	air	ticket	reservations
with	scb	as	the	parent	company	the	robinhood	travel	app	enjoys	the	strength	of	better	exchange	rates	and	the	ability	to	issue	instant	receipts	to	customers
in	terms	of	customer	service	robinhood	travel	has	hour	call	center	featuring	live	operators	unlike	other	otas	that	use	bots
in	the	first	year	robinhood	travel	aims	to	list	some	hotels	on	the	platform	with	active	travelers	making	bookings	helping	entrepreneurs	save	million	baht	and	seeing	one	billion	baht	in	turnover
robinhood	wants	to	help	hotel	and	tourism	business	operators	get	back	on	their	feet
in	february	the	application	will	be	open	for	hotel	reservations	and	in	april	for	air	ticket	booking	package	tours	activities	and	rental	cars
we	are	also	planning	to	launch	robinhood	story	as	travel	blog	to	inspire	those	seeking	to	travel	to	find	information	with	links	for	booking	accommodation	or	activities

if	country	economic	system	is	like	human	body	smes	are	like	blood	vessels	that	help	nourish	the	body	to	survive
but	whenever	the	blood	vessels	are	clogged	would	inevitably	affect	the	body	system
scb	recognizes	the	importance	of	sme	entrepreneurs	therefore	has	organized	the	dots	digital	commerce	online	training	program	to	help	strengthen	the	potential	of	thai	smes
and	have	shield	against	competition	in	world	without	borders	ready	to	sharpen	weapons	with	online	marketing	strategies	to	face	new	challenges	in	the	digital	age
mrs	pikun	srimahunt	senior	executive	vice	president	chief	sme	banking	officer	spoke	at	the	opening	of	this	training	program	course	why	is	growth	mindset	important	to	smes
developing	new	skills	and	knowledge	in	business	it	is	something	that	sme	entrepreneurs	must	constantly	learn
to	be	able	to	keep	up	with	the	new	world	with	technology	as	an	indicator	of	who	will	win	or	lose	in	this	game	khun	pikun	said	people	who	are	sme	entrepreneurs	must	have	knowledge	in	doing	business	in	degrees	and	also	have	growth	mindset	especially	to	see	opportunities
not	giving	up	on	the	obstacles	that	lie	in	front	of	you
especially	now	that	our	lives	are	inevitable	with	technology
because	technology	will	be	the	main	weapon	that	helps	smes	to	survive	disruption
therefore	understanding	online	sales	on	the	platform
it	is	very	important	to	use	technology	to	reduce	costs	and	use	data	to	know	the	real	customers	how	does	big	person	support	small	person
based	on	the	importance	of	smes	scb	views	that	the	bank	main	function	in	addition	to	providing	loans	for	business	capital	still	wants	to	become	business	alliance	with	smes	so	that	they	can	move	on
especially	in	times	of	crisis	that	needs	help	if	smes	can	survive	banks	can	go	on	either
this	is	the	source	of	the	training	program	to	help	smes	to	be	able	to	walk	the	business	game	to	the	online	platform
through	an	intensive	week	course	more	than	trainees	will	adapt	their	thinking	methods	and	strategies	to	enter	the	digital	battlefield
the	bank	acts	as	an	intermediary	to	connect	each	dot	to	form	powerful	line
to	lead	the	thai	economy	through	the	crisis	and	to	become	global	trade	arena
khun	pikun	said	the	bank	sees	that	helping	smes	become	stronger	in	this	era
the	need	to	reduce	costs	effectively
as	such	the	bank	invests	in	building	platform	to	help	small	people	have	an	ecosystem	to	do	business	and	be	able	to	compete	freely
take	robinhood	for	example	with	the	intention	of	helping	food	businesses	to	have	an	online	storefront	without	paying	any	fees	or	gp
while	ecological	stakeholders	such	as	the	rider	group	get	job
and	next	year	robinhood	will	expand	its	services	to	local	hotel	businesses
this	provides	channel	to	sell	rooms	on	the	platform	without	having	to	pay	fee
in	addition	the	bank	also	has	scb	trade	club	platform	to	help	import	export	business	operators	able	to	trade	products	in	every	corner	of	the	world
as	well	as	collecting	trade	information	documents	as	well	as	being	medium	for	matching	partners	from	around	the	world
there	is	also	fee	free	money	transfer	system	that	helps	smes	get	convenience	and	speed
including	joining	hands	with	partners	to	introduce	business	assistants	to	smes	such	as
platform	to	help	online	sellers	to	store	pack	deliver	goods
resulting	in	cost	savings	and	efficient	stock	management	etc
the	role	of	the	bank	is	not	just	the	lender	but	will	be	like	true	friend	who	is	ready	to	walk	beside	passing	on	success	to	thai	smes	to	grow	stronger	without	limits
sme	main	keys	to	empowering	smes	khun	pikun	reiterated	that	as	for	technology	it	inevitable	so	must	face
would	like	to	say	that	the	secret	that	makes	business	lose	or	win	is	at	the	cost
if	smes	know	how	to	use	technology	as	helper	it	will	bring	enormous	benefits	to	businesses	from	using	technology	such	as	the	question	that	sme	entrepreneurs	have	is	whether	the	bank	uses	data	as	information	for	lending	decisions	but	usually	online	sellers	who	accept	cash	can	not	pay	taxes
but	when	taking	the	income	through	the	bank	the	irs	will	know	how	much	the	real	income	is
how	do	the	smes	adjust
khun	pikun	replied	that	normally	customer	information	cannot	be	disclosed	because	it	is	considered	confidential
but	want	you	to	look	at	it	in	reverse
paying	taxes	correctly	will	help	smes	to	recognize	the	true	cost	of	profits	of	the	business	and	should	not	be	afraid	of	paying	taxes
should	find	solution	that	if	you	must	pay	tax	how	to	do	it	as	little	as	possible
plus	the	advantages	of	receiving	money	through	banks	sellers	also	get	data	that	can	be	used	for	cost	management	or	collecting	statistics	on	product	sales	as	well
more	importantly	it	will	make	it	easier	to	borrow	money	to	expand	your	business
because	the	bank	saw	all	the	data	finally	khun	pikun	concluded	today	smes	have	to	adapt	and	have	strong	passion	if	they	want	to	survive
must	find	an	opportunity	to	offer	the	difference	and	your	own	identity
have	to	change	quickly	and	make	yourself	lighter	that	is	the	sme	survival	technique	of	this	era	that	khun	pikun	has	said

technologies	become	parts	of	our	life	and	we	are	getting	used	to	them
cell	phones	are	capable	of	doing	many	things	including	transferring	money	booking	ticket	ordering	food	or	calling	cab
these	conveniences	have	shaped	people	to	be	technology	dependent	and	willing	to	pay	an	extra	for	their	convenient	lives
this	is	where	the	lazy	economy	and	lazy	consumer	starts
we	can	call	such	behavior	as	need	for	the	most	convenient	fastest	and	reduced	complication	which	makes	people	happy	as	they	do	not	need	to	do	things	by	themselves
top	lazy	activities	for	thais	it	is	certain	that	new	generation	people	are	addicted	to	conveniences	around	the	world
according	to	the	research	based	on	thais	which	can	be	classified	to	generation	generation	generation	baby	boomers	it	is	found	that	activities	which	thai	people	are	too	lazy	to	do	are	exercising	waiting	in	line	for	shopping	house	working	reading	cooking	meeting	or	talking	with	many	people	doing	skincare	study	working	going	out	for	shopping	and	traveling	around	source	college	of	management	mahidol	university	besides	taobao	chinese	leading	shopping	site	reports	that	chinese	consumers	under	years	old	love	convenience	and	are	willing	to	pay	for	goods	or	services	in	order	to	save	their	energy	and	time
this	promotes	the	convenient	good	products	line	sales	up	to	and	the	top	are	the	time	applied	eyeshadows	multipurpose	hot	air	ovens	adjustable	game	playing	chairs	and	smart	home	devices
sloth	the	strategy	for	the	lazies	conducting	business	for	the	lazies	needs	the	final	move	which	is	responding	to	those	convenience	addicted	peoples	needs	which	are	the	most	convenient	saving	energy	no	wasting	time	no	need	to	leave	home	easing	the	burden	and	promoting	life	quality
if	business	can	offer	goods	or	services	which	makes	peoples	life	better	more	convenient	and	easier	such	business	will	be	able	to	attract	this	type	of	consumer
the	keys	to	success	are	business	for	the	lazies
since	the	market	has	consumers	that	expect	the	highest	level	of	convenience	which	kind	of	business	or	service	is	the	best	for	these	consumers
on	demand	services	it	can	be	seen	that	lot	of	on	demand	services	have	been	around	these	years	as	they	offer	conveniences	for	people	for	example	cleaning	services	personal	shoppers	drivers	movers	and	food	delivery
according	to	the	college	of	management	mahidol	universitys	study	thailands	food	delivery	industry	has	grown	billion	baht	year
recently	scb	has	initiated	an	out	of	the	box	food	delivery	service	robinhood	new	alternative	responding	to	the	lazy	need	which	more	detail	can	be	found	at	robinhood	thai	food	delivery	application	for	thais
no	need	to	move	touch	hold	products	the	advance	in	technologies	leads	to	more	automation	and	hand	free	products	which	respond	to	the	needs	of	the	lazies	well
the	products	include	cleaning	robot	automated	vacuum	cleaner	dishwasher	cloth	folder	and	automated	toothbrush
this	kind	of	technology	has	also	expanded	to	the	automated	store	which	is	cashier	less	and	the	lazy	holder	which	frees	the	hand	from	holding	things
ready	to	use	products	when	laziness	takes	over	ready	to	eat	drinks	and	used	products	are	extremely	attractive	to	the	consumers	who	desire	the	highest	level	of	convenience
these	products	include	all	in	one	foundation	powder	which	heals	covers	and	protects	the	skin	from	sunlight	helps	reducing	makeup	time	one	time	apply	eyeshadow	dry	shampoo	that	helps	clean	the	hair	warmed	rice	without	microwave	ready	to	cook	meals	for	people	who	do	not	have	time	to	do	their	own	groceries
better	together	type	services	some	of	the	people	might	find	themselves	lacking	the	motivation	to	achieve	as	they	are	afraid	of	tiredness
hence	founding	an	online	community	business	to	promote	the	feeling	of	better	together	can	help	motivate	people	to	succeed	as	they	are	helping	or	competing	with	others
these	kinds	of	services	include	partyhaan	application	which	helps	to	find	people	to	share	the	cab	ride	or	netflix	which	agrees	with	the	th	lazy	activity	of	thai	that	is	meeting	or	talking	with	many	people
read	less	listen	to	more	service	in	these	couple	of	years	the	podcast	business	industry	has	grown	noticeably	as	it	responds	to	the	need	for	convenience	as	the	consumer	can	listen	to	the	podcast	anywhere	and	anytime
listening	to	podcasts	does	not	require	much	concentration	as	reading	which	agrees	with	the	research	mentioned	before	that	of	thai	people	are	too	lazy	to	read	as	they	prefer	to	listen	while	doing	other	activities
short	videos	are	also	popular	among	them	which	includes	tiktok	that	offers	less	than	one	minute	how	to
it	is	no	surprise	that	the	lazy	economy	is	one	of	the	fast	growing	markets	as	it	helps	fix	the	pain	point	of	today	consumers	who	are	busy	living	their	lives
since	the	products	or	services	that	can	help	to	ease	complications	reducing	time	and	freeing	people	to	do	more	important	task	are	vital	keys
business	owner	or	marketeer	needs	to	gain	consumer	insights	to	attract	convenience	lovers
it	is	expected	that	these	kinds	of	consumers	will	increase	in	the	near	future	because	of	technological	advancement

new	normal	is	new	challenge	that	organizational	leaders	must	organize	their	troops	to	be	able	to	move	forward
any	organization	if	leaders	have	vision	see	through	opportunities	during	uncertainty
would	be	like	having	business	compass	to	walk	right	that	does	not	get	lost
what	should	organizational	leaders	study
are	there	any	qualities	that	will	break	through	the	trends	of	the	new	normal	era
scb	in	collaboration	with	the	national	innovation	agency	organized	training	in	the	nia	scb	innovation	based	enterprise	ibe	course	class	for	sme	entrepreneurs	to	create	new	generation	of	leaders	capable	of	leading	businesses	to	counter	the	new	normal	trend
khun	apiwut	founding	partner	of	slingshot	company	shared	the	global	and	thai	trends	after	the	covid	crisis
the	success	component	of	an	organization	and	what	skills	do	leaders	need	to	survive	the	business
global	trend	what	will	happen	to	thailand	after	covid
apiwut	said	many	people	might	think	that	after	the	coronavirus	if	there	was	vaccine	everything	would	be	back	to	how	it	was
the	business	will	continue	as	it	used	to	be
but	in	truth	there	is	no	way	to	go	back	to	the	same
for	executives	it	is	important	to	know	what	new	normal	will	be	to	guide	the	vision	and	direction	of	the	organization
and	when	asked	what	when	talking	about	new	normal	some	people	might	say	it	is	masking	sell	stuff	online	the	economic	crisis	will	occur
using	robots	to	replace	workers	from	workers	work	from	home	what	is	new	normal
so	as	not	to	be	confused	about	what	will	happen	in	the	world	after	covid
would	like	to	bring	one	tool	to	introduce	to	the	executives	called	future	platform
which	is	combination	of	research	studies	with	ai	to	find	various	phenomena	that	will	happen	as	living	research	due	to	updated	data	from	real	time
this	research	is	called	the	world	radar	after	covid
to	show	the	phenomena	that	will	happen	after	the	covid	ends	it	is	called	future	radar
there	is	way	to	look	at	this	example
the	periphery	refers	to	things	that	have	not	yet	happened	but	will	happen	within	the	next	years
point	near	the	center	means	something	that	has	already	happened	or	will	soon	happen
each	color	has	different	meaning	green	dots	mean	very	high	probability	blue	dots	mean	signs	of	occurrence	but	this	phenomenon	can	disappear	and	red	dots	mean	uncertain
that	this	phenomenon	will	happen	or	not
but	if	that	happens	it	will	have	serious	impact
this	future	radar	would	like	executives	to	try	this	tool	to	see	what	changes	or	trends	in	the	post	covid	world	are	going	on
anything	that	will	affect	our	business	will	be	used	as	guideline	for	adjustment
business	or	deal	with	something	that	will	happen	soon
able	to	see	world	trends	at	from	the	global	trend	after	covid	there	will	be	phenomena	and	some	events	that	may	not	be	related	to	thailand	at	all
therefore	to	delve	deeper	there	was	survey	of	thai	executives	that	from	the	global	trend	that	took	place	choose	the	top	predicted	that	such	phenomena	will	affect	thailand	consist	of	phenomena
as	follows	that	will	occur	in	thailand
business	executives	need	to	spot	the	trend	to	be	used	as	guideline	for	planning	strategies	and	creating	business	opportunities	further
and	each	phenomenon	will	affect	the	business	according	to	the	industry	differently
revealing	the	key	factor	that	the	company	used	to	flourish	is	to	fail
apiwut	further	said	that	in	the	past	years	for	example	many	mobile	companies	have	closed
it	was	merged	into	motorola	nokia	nec	ericson	and	panasonic
let	try	to	figure	out	what	caused	these	companies	to	fail
the	answer	is	internal	factors	are	policy	vision	corporate	culture	etc	and	external	factors	are	competitors	changing	consumer	behavior	economic	conditions	etc
both	factors	can	cause	business	failure	as	well
the	impact	is	greater	than	external	factors	why
factors	for	organizational	success	would	like	you	to	observe	why	when	there	is	an	economic	crisis	that	is	an	external	factor	only	some	organizations	survive	and	some	have	disappeared
this	means	that	internal	factors	have	greater	impact	on	how	business	will	survive	or	not	survive	so	here	are	the	seven	internal	factors	that	will	lead	to	the	success	of	the	organization	leader	level	means	business	must	have	leader	level	to	make	the	business	survive
so	what	is	level	leader
level	leader	must	have	qualities	means	good	dare	cute	good	job	good	job	dare	to	change	do	something	new	and	lovable
by	the	leader	there	are	levels	as	follows	right	peoplemeaning	not	all	employees	are	valuable	resources
but	only	the	right	employees	are	the	most	valuable	assets	of	the	organization
in	the	past	organizations	would	view	the	turnover	balance	as	being	high	as	bad
but	now	it	is	viewed	from	regret	loss	or	regretful	loss	if	there	are	many	it	is	considered	bad	for	example	even	if	the	organization	has	turnover	amount	as	high	as	if	in	that	amount	there	is	regret	loss	of	only	it	is	good
focusmeans	businesses	must	have	focus	because	they	have	limited	resources
you	should	not	do	many	things	you	must	know	your	strengths
businesses	need	to	know	what	to	do	or	not	to	do	for	example	netflix	only	does	movies	series	documentaries
but	not	doing	news	and	sports	feedback	mechanismrefers	to	the	business	must	have	mechanism	for	customers	and	employees	to	feedback	to	the	management
the	mechanism	does	not	have	to	be	complicated	or	invested	in	anything	for	example	golf	courses	have	caddy	feedback	mechanism
there	are	cans	to	choose	from	smiling	face	stupid	face	skewed	face
can	recognize	feedback	from	customers	culture	of	disciplinethis	means	businesses	tend	to	waste	their	time	on	matters	that	they	agreed	but	did	not	do	or	things	that	were	disagreed	within	the	meeting	room	and	then	didn	speak
therefore	businesses	should	create	culture	of	discipline	within	the	organization
this	culture	can	only	be	achieved	when	there	are	values	that	have	been	done	over	long	time	from	the	behavior	of	many	people	people	in	the	organization	that	do	each	other	technology	to	accelerate	successmeans	businesses	need	to	find	new	technologies	to	drive	the	organization	to	success	faster	and	faster	agilitythis	means	businesses	must	be	ready	to	adjust	at	all	times
the	leaders	or	business	executives	in	the	new	normal	era	must	have	vision	for	change
follow	the	latest	news	and	events	to	make	appropriate	decisions	in	difficult	and	unpredictable	situations	including	strengthening	internal	factors	to	create	sustainable	component	of	success	for	the	organization	and	can	face	the	new	normal	wave	that	will	never	go	back	to	the	same	nia	scb	innovation	based	enterprise	ibe	course	class	has	duration	of	weeks	from	november	february	interested	parties	can	follow	the	summary	of	the	training	content	at	and	source	nia	scb	innovation	based	enterprise	ibe	course	class	by	mr	apiwut	pimolaengsuriya	founding	partner	slingshot	company	december	for	sme
leader	is	person	who	brings	whole	organization	to	reach	the	goal	and	also	has	to	be	good	coach	especially	as	the	world	is	not	the	same	as	before
covid	has	left	scar	and	anxiety	for	many	people
so	overcoming	these	changes	and	troubles	that	happened	everybody	in	the	organization	needs	to	collaborate	and	has	the	same	vision	and	goal	because	only	the	leader	alone	could	not	make	it	happen
how	to	encourage	the	team	to	support	whole	organization	to	reach	the	same	goal	and	two	way	communication	with	trust	are	the	important	factor
the	right	coaching	to	prepare	employees	to	be	more	proactive	and	grow	together	with	the	changing	of	new	normal
lets	hear	some	good	coaching	tips	and	how	to	win	from	ajarn	jeab	achara	chaicharoen	ph	from	accomm	group	who	received	the	medal	of	learning	development	and	coaching	and	women	leadership	from	cmo	asia
how	important	is	coaching	to	bring	team	to	reach	the	goal	during	this	crisis
ajarn	jeab	told	us	that	coaching	is	also	important	in	normal	situation	but	it	gets	doubled	while	being	in	crisis
it	can	be	summarized	in	topics	as	following	future	oriented	future	oriented	which	is	the	looking	to	the	future	new	opportunity	and	bringing	the	team	from	comfort	zone	to	new	hopes
connecting	the	whole	team	together	creates	two	way	communication
there	should	be	human	interaction	at	the	time	of	crisis	with	social	distancing	which	makes	people	stress	and	lower	those	human	interactions	or	communication
although	the	crisis	is	gone	the	remaining	of	those	are	still	there
we	cannot	let	that	happen	because	team	management	needs	to	have	two	way	communication
ajarn	jeab	gave	us	an	example	of	an	it	company	that	most	employees	are	working	with	computers	and	low	communication	either	between	employees	or	superior	and	employees
since	the	cybercrime	happened	they	could	not	work	via	computers	anymore	but	they	still	need	to	go	to	the	office
hence	their	behaviors	shifted	to	more	talking	and	human	interaction	with	more	new	ideas	coming	up	and	more	friendly	environment
therefore	the	management	team	is	trying	to	build	communication	and	human	interaction	organization	which	results	in	higher	score	of	customer	satisfaction	and	employee	engagement
coaching	is	important	because	it	helps	create	friendly	and	innovative	creative	environment	to	let	the	whole	organization	overcome	the	crisis
moving	from	strategic	thinking	to	strategic	acting	during	the	crisis	recovery	period	every	entrepreneur	wants	their	businesses	to	grow	as	shape	or	shape	therefore	strategy	shall	be	implemented
however	the	problem	is	they	have	good	strategy	but	it	could	not	be	practically	implemented	and	the	main	trouble	comes	from	employees	behavior
the	organization	wants	to	change	but	its	employees	do	not
from	the	harvard	business	review	analytics	research	shows	the	result	of	what	value	should	the	company	has	which	says	that	of	the	success	factor	is	the	team	and	coaching	skill	of	leader
what	kind	of	team	will	be	the	winner	in	this	new	normal	period
how	to	be	the	winner
the	most	stressful	things	for	people	are	change	lost	and	spreading	disease	which	make	us	need	to	control	ourselves
there	was	comparative	experiment	about	facing	and	solving	these	difficult	problems	by	dividing	people	into	groups
the	control	factor	is	the	same	environment	but	different	food
they	allowed	group	to	eat	cookies	but	no	spinach	and	group	must	eat	all	spinach	but	no	cookies
this	means	group	needs	to	control	themselves	to	not	take	what	they	want
then	both	groups	have	to	solve	the	problem	to	see	who	will	give	up	first
the	result	is	group	who	took	all	spinach	gave	up	first	because	they	already	used	all	their	energy	to	control	themselves	and	no	energy	left	to	solve	the	problem
this	is	why	they	gave	up	so	fast
hence	to	support	people	to	be	can	safe	learning	environment	is	required
safe	learning	environment	to	employees	about	what	should	be	included	for	the	future	competency	autonomygiving	employees	the	freedom	to	learn	whether	topics	or	type	fairness	the	fair	return	for	employees	work	and	effort	engage	be	part	of	the	team	and	feel	included	coaching	emphasizes	on	two	way	communication	building	safe	learning	space	building	trust	and	letting	employees	commit	by	themselves
do	not	force	them	to	do	so
how	coaching	helps	the	team	to	win
coaching	helps	unlock	skills	of	the	team
team	must	have	the	want	feeling	by	themselves	and	also	must	know	what	is	holding	them	back	from	moving	forward	because	no	one	knows	what	is	truly	inside	their	minds
they	better	known	themselves
coaching	only	helps	them	better	understand	themselves	as	known	as	good	coach	introduces	you	to	yourself
good	coaching	is	not	about	forcing	and	telling	them	what	to	do
it	is	about	two	way	communication	that	lets	that	person	know	themselves	more
if	the	leader	wants	to	eliminate	the	negative	thinking	and	fear	coaching	need	to	make	them	understand	themselves	because	if	they	do	not	know	themselves	they	cannot	demolish	their	weaknesses
it	is	also	known	as	you	cannot	get	rid	of	something	you	don	know
coach	needs	to	make	other	people	understand	what	is	holding	him	her	back
also	making	them	know	what	the	unvalued	skill	for	the	team	is
actually	of	our	thinking	is	from	emotions	not	rationalities
so	good	coach	needs	to	be	good	listener	that	is	their	emotion	and	rationality	bad	for	the	organization	or	not	which	are	as	following	these	thoughts	cannot	let	team	win
good	coach	will	not	blame	any	person	but	will	tell	good	way	to	reflect	their	negative	thoughts
this	is	hard	feeling	hard	to	resolve	and	needs	lot	of	effort	from	the	coach
in	this	new	normal	world	many	things	have	changed	and	we	have	to	see	everything	as	beginners	eyes
because	those	eyes	see	everything	fresh	and	new	so	they	tend	to	study	more	and	find	new	opportunities	greater	than	those	who	think	they	are	experts	with	less	possibility
ajarn	jeab	told	us	an	example	of	an	automotive	company	since	the	money	crisis	in	they	had	to	reduce	the	selling	price	to	be	no	benefit
however	hyundai	thought	that	it	was	not	the	right	method	so	they	changed	to	see	things	as	beginners	eyes
they	started	by	doing	customer	surveys	and	found	that	it	is	not	about	money	but	it	is	about	their	fear	of	being	unemployed	in	the	next	year
hence	hyundai	started	the	campaign	of	buying	car	and	can	return	in	case	they	are	unemployed
in	the	end	there	were	only	returning	cars
this	is	an	example	of	beginner	eyes	that	do	not	judge	from	the	past
do	and	don	in	coaching	dowith	dont	team	can	reach	the	goal	only	by	the	effort	of	leader	and	team	to	build	strong	power	and	the	same	focus	especially	after	the	crisis	and	at	the	beginning	of	the	new	normal	era	that	everything	has	changed
two	way	communication	trust	in	each	other	and	safe	learning	environment	will	induce	new	innovations	and	reach	sustainable	achievement	in	this	new	world
therefore	the	coaching	role	of	leader	is	important	to	pull	an	employee	performance	and	positive	thoughts	and	bring	the	whole	team	to	the	goal

today	technology	has	come	into	play	in	almost	every	industry	around	the	world
nothing	can	stop	or	hinder	growth
only	accepting	and	adapting	before	disrupt	is	finally	swallowed	up
dr	pailin	chuchottaworn	chairman	of	the	vidyasirimedhi	institute	council	shared	vision	with	the	participants	of	mission	the	boot	camp	of	advanced	corporate	transformation	generation	as	follows	the	era	of	change	of	humanity	german	scientists	presented	the	results	of	their	research
humans	have	undergone	eras	of	transformation
world	era	there	was	change	at	the	end	of	the	ayutthaya	period
it	was	the	time	when	europe	left	the	dark	age
known	as	an	industrial	revolution	the	steam	engine	was	discovered
after	its	discovery	the	evolution	of	the	world	changed	dramatically
not	long	after	it	was	the	world	era	with	the	discovery	of	electric	power
world	era	is	the	era	that	has	changed	from	analog	to	digital
dr	pairin	added	that	at	that	time	it	was	the	first	year	at	chulalongkorn	university
students	can	use	the	calculator	in	the	exam	room
for	gen	people	it	will	overlap	between	the	analog	world	and	the	digital	world
as	for	gen	and	alpha	they	are	digital	natives	who	have	tried	to	bring	rotary	phone	to	this	generation
it	turns	out	that	they	cannot	use	it
when	asked	what	is	world	era
dr	pairin	replied	that	no	one	knew	what	it	would	be	like
but	what	is	going	to	happen	in	the	future	will	be	the	use	of	artificial	intelligence	ai	and	many	robots
speed	of	digital	transformation	since	the	world	entered	the	digital	age	hardware	advancements	happen	at	rapid	pace	as	can	be	seen	from	hard	disk	drives
the	first	generation	megabyte	the	size	of	locker
until	now	it	has	become	micro	sd	card	terabyte	the	size	of	fingertip
the	advancement	of	hardware	is	exponential
while	the	advancement	of	software	has	grown	equally
memory	is	larger	while	cpu	is	smaller
it	is	noticeable	that	during	the	hardware	development	computer	engineers	play	key	role
but	at	certain	point	in	development	software	began	to	play	role
programmers	play	an	important	role	but	when	using	more	hardware	and	software	it	creates	huge	amount	of	data
now	data	has	become	an	asset	of	the	organization
data	scientists	have	role	to	play	in	taking	advantage	of	data
retracing	the	history	of	the	digital	age	in	the	first	era	is	web	is	the	era	of	basic	web	java	html
the	second	era	is	web	is	the	era	that	brought	computers	together	until	it	became	social	network	and	now	it	is	entering	the	third	era	which	is	web	an	era	in	which	the	world	social	networks	can	create	artificial	objects
the	various	changes	that	occur	in	the	world	it	was	not	born	of	scientist	alone
but	because	the	natural	development	of	technology	is	exponential
from	the	illustration	today	technology	costs	are	reduced	exponentially	including	storge	cpu	sensor	and	bandwidth	point	to	point	data	transmission	which	is	driving	change	in	the	digital	industry
therefore	in	this	era	if	anyone	is	thinking	of	using	technology	to	do	something
it	will	be	easier	to	do	as	the	cost	keeps	getting	cheaper
all	this	creates	digital	vortex	or	the	digital	vortex	that	engulfs	everything	causing	disruption
there	is	continuous	innovation
causing	the	question	so	what	the	end	of	the	change
the	answer	is	no	one	knows	but	elon	mask	is	now	funding	research	into	connecting	animal	brains	to	computers
and	in	the	future	if	the	human	brain	can	be	connected	to	computer
think	about	what	will	happen
there	are	sci	fi	films	that	tell	the	story	of	the	humanoid	leading	to	the	destruction	of	the	world	and	the	films	about	the	progress	of	the	future	world
but	we	don	know	in	the	end
where	will	the	humans	go	but	surely	this	end	will	surely	come	quickly
and	it	might	come	while	alive	said	dr	pailin
real	world	vs	virtual	world	today	we	have	two	planets
the	first	is	the	physical	world
it	has	population	of	over	billion	people	comprising	countries
every	country	has	its	own	borders	laws	central	banks	their	own	currency
while	the	second	world	is	the	digital	world	with	population	of	billion	people	accounting	for	of	the	first	world	the	second	world	is	world	without	borders	without	gender	age	nationality	law	or	even	central	bank
by	these	two	worlds	connected	via	satellite	fiber	optics
today	people	live	in	two	worlds
and	will	spend	more	and	more	time	in	the	second	world
if	we	notice	that	the	real	world	and	the	virtual	world	are	very	different
in	the	digital	world	data	travels	faster	than	light
whatever	happens	in	the	digital	world	is	so	fast	that	people	on	this	second	world	impatient	can	wait	for	anything	everything	is	intangible	intangible	and	dynamic	is	very	fast	but	if	say	that	both	worlds	totally	separated	is	not	true	either
because	there	are	some	connections	illustration
as	illustrated	in	the	physical	world	economists	divide	the	world	into	two	sectors	the	real	sector	such	as	real	estate	trading	and	the	financial	sector
in	the	financial	sector	money	does	not	exist
the	first	era	was	born	from	the	exchange	of	things	between	each	other
later	find	things	that	are	convenient	to	exchange	as	an	intermediary	such	as	gold	later	coins
later	paper	was	used	with	this	paper	certificate
money	is	fictitious	thing	that	does	not	exist
therefore	the	money	that	humans	come	up	with	is	called	fiat	money
we	do	not	call	money
this	is	assuming	that	the	real	sector	is	called	the	financial	sector	with	the	central	bank	in	charge	and	when	the	financial	sector	is	fictitious
therefore	it	relates	to	the	virtual	world
make	people	who	want	to	do	anything	in	the	financial	sector	are	called	fintech
know	the	money	in	the	virtual	world	because	money	is	fictitious	make	people	have	ideas	to	make	money	in	the	digital	world
by	having	to	confirm	the	existence	of	that	item	thus	the	origin	of	blockchain	was	born	in	person	who	goes	by	the	pseudonym	satoshi	nakamoto	came	up	with	an	algorithm	for	use	in	the	digital	world
blockchain	algorithms	turn	the	non	existent	with	smart	contracts	as	proof	of	its	existence	and	are	directed	by	blockchain	systems	can	verify	their	presence	on	the	system
by	having	the	many	computers	in	the	system	act	as	distributed	ledgers	monitoring	each	other
in	theory	blockchain	algorithms	cannot	be	attacked	or	destroyed
many	people	believe	that	blockchain	technology	is	stable
but	money	in	the	digital	world	is	not	only	cryptocurrency	alone	some	people	especially	baby	bloomer	see	that	cryptocurrency	it	something	that	can	be	trusted
thus	creating	another	digital	money	called	cbdc	central	bank	digital	currency	is	digital	currency	issued	by	the	central	bank	of	each	country	but	the	truth	is	fait	money	in	digital	form
there	is	also	stable	coin	hybrid	digital	currency
cryptocurrency	and	cbdc	where	the	money	must	be	tied	to	something	for	example	issuing	and	then	attaching	the	money	to	the	dollar	value	to	provide	constant	value	such	as	facebook	libra
when	asked	about	cryptocurrency	is	it	about	to	collapse
dr	pairin	said	that	want	you	to	think	that	bitcoin	is	still	equal	to	bitcoin	but	what	makes	it	look	like	it	collapses
because	people	associate	bitcoin	with	the	fait	currency	the	bearer	is	susceptible	to	bitcoin	decline	but	bitcoins	value	lies	in	the	potential	of	blockchain	technology
some	people	say	that	money	cryptocurrency	is	it	money	that	is	not	transparent
dr	pairin	said	that	in	fact	money	cryptocurrency	it	is	the	most	transparent	money	in	the	world
because	every	transaction	has	code	as	block	to	be	stored	in	the	blockchain	then	the	block	that	enters	the	system	will	stay	forever
able	to	check	the	transaction	to	see	what	happened	between	who	and	who
fait	money	on	the	other	hand	is	not	transparent
because	they	can	trace	the	origin	of	the	money	for	example	if	someone	makes	baht	tie	falls	on	the	side	of	the	road	and	someone	picks	it	up	and	can	use	it	at	all
no	one	knows	where	the	money	came	from
data	treasure	in	the	digital	world	in	addition	to	money	in	the	digital	world	dr	pairin	also	said	that	the	digital	world	is	moving	closer	and	closer	to	the	physical	world	such	as	the	internet	of	things
in	the	future	things	in	the	physical	world	become	intelligent	we	can	control	or	talk	to	them
it	can	be	seen	that	when	the	world	enters	the	web	era	everything	will	be	decentralized	no	one	controls	hence	the	origin	of	the	term	defi	or	decentralized	finance	with	blockchain	technology	to	record	and	process	transactions	instead	of	intermediaries	and	will	be	the	link	between
this	makes	the	transaction	time	fees	very	low
in	the	digital	world	data	is	the	most	important	thing
to	create	data	it	must	lead	to	engagement
engagement	will	lead	to	enormous	data	and	data	will	lead	to	the	most	useful	usefulness
therefore	the	person	with	the	most	data	is	the	winner
to	use	the	data	to	be	useful	there	must	be	ai	as	an	assistant
before	parting	dr	pailin	said	in	cyberspace	we	may	not	know	that	people	who	talk	to	us
we	may	not	be	human	because	the	digital	world	has	no	gender	no	age	no	rules	therefore	in	the	face	of	global	economic	recession	due	to	various	situations	it	is	important	for	businesses	to	be	resilient	to	the	impact	of	unpredictable	challenges
it	is	secret	weapon	that	will	help	maintain	stability
increasing	the	capability	of	the	business	sector	to	be	stable	even	in	difficult	conditions	source	mission	the	boot	camp	of	advanced	corporate	transformation	class	by	dr	pailin	chuchottaworn	president	of	the	vidyasirimedhi	institute	council	may	at	the	siam	commercial	bank	headquarters
digital	transformation	exponential	growth
with	over	sixteen	years	in	vietnam	khun	adisai	prasertsri	ceo	of	chance	and	challenge	co	ltd	cac	vietnam	an	importer	and	distributor	of	thai	products	in	vietnam	specializing	in	logistics	has	been	successful	in	bringing	thai	products	to	the	vietnamese	market	in	provinces
he	shared	his	experience	with	khun	akesak	wiwattananon	business	development	officer	scb	international	banking	function	scb	ho	chi	minh	branch
pioneering	investors	perspective	khun	adisai	recounted	his	decision	to	invest	in	vietnam	sixteen	years	ago	saying	that	at	that	time	vietnam	had	population	of	million	with	gdp	capita	of	usd	per	person	per	year
he	believed	that	the	market	could	grow	even	more	so	khun	adisai	decided	to	set	up	distribution	infrastructure	in	vietnam
now	vietnam	has	some	million	people	classified	as	middle	class	with	population	growth	of	people	per	year
experienced	in	running	business	related	to	consumer	products	khun	adisai	decided	to	enter	the	vietnamese	market	in	when	thailand	was	promoting	exports
thai	products	were	well	known	among	the	vietnamese	people	for	their	good	quality	and	prices	that	were	not	out	of	reach
in	addition	vietnamese	people	liked	to	visit	thailand	so	they	knew	thai	products	well
with	higher	purchasing	power	they	began	to	enjoy	more	product	choices	from	japan	and	korea	as	well
vietnam	permitted	foreigners	to	do	business	in	their	country	after	becoming	world	trade	organization	wto	member	in	having	entered	vietnam	in	by	registering	his	company	with	local	partner	khun	adisai	was	able	to	register	his	company	under	his	own	name	in	entering	the	market	before	anyone	else	provided	more	opportunities
in	he	set	up	distribution	centers	in	several	provinces
later	in	the	company	opened	its	first	distribution	center	in	da	nang	taking	care	of	five	provinces	in	the	central	region
by	he	had	six	distribution	centers	across	the	country	and	expanded	to	ten	locations	in	operated	by	team	of	sales	and	back	office	support	staff
with	rapid	economic	growth	and	the	geographical	characteristics	of	long	country	distribution	of	products	is	an	important	factor	to	reach	consumers	as	quickly	and	as	much	as	possible
therefore	my	company	focuses	on	opening	distribution	centers	said	khun	adisai
scb	business	partner	for	thais	in	vietnam	cac	vietnam	used	financial	services	from	scb	then	vinasiam	bank	from	the	outset
when	scb	opened	an	office	in	ho	chi	minh	city	cac	vietnam	was	not	reluctant	to	continue	the	business	relationship
scb	treats	thai	investors	in	vietnam	as	more	than	just	its	customers	but	as	relatives	and	friends
the	bank	took	good	care	of	cac	vietnam	even	though	it	was	just	small	company
khun	adisai	said	that	when	it	comes	to	business	matters	no	one	can	be	trusted	better	than	thai	bank	as	we	speak	the	same	language	and	understand	investors
he	would	like	to	recommend	that	thai	investors	doing	business	in	vietnam	use	scb	as	partner	for	business	consultation
mr	akesak	further	explained	that	scb	has	operated	in	vietnam	since	as	vinasiam	bank
it	was	joint	venture	with	local	bank	and	the	cp	group
scb	received	license	to	operate	branch	in	and	the	banks	first	branch	was	opened	in	ho	chi	minh	city	in	scbs	strength	lies	in	its	knowledgeable	staff	working	with	the	bank	for	long	time
they	have	good	understanding	of	business	rules	and	regulations	in	vietnam	while	the	customer	care	team	has	vietnamese	staff	with	extensive	experience
as	full	branch	scb	provides	complete	range	of	services	from	opening	investment	and	operating	accounts	used	in	vietnam	trade	finance	bank	guarantees	currency	exchange	for	both	usd	and	thai	baht	and	loans	to	thai	and	vietnamese	customers
the	advantage	of	using	thai	banks	speaking	the	same	language	is	that	it	is	more	convenient	and	easier
process	can	start	from	thailand	with	no	need	to	send	documents	to	vietnam	or	customers	can	send	them	via	scb	in	thailand
this	is	especially	convenient	during	the	covid	outbreak	when	investors	can	fly	to	vietnam
most	importantly	scb	is	familiar	with	the	network	of	thai	businesses	and	thai	government	agencies	in	vietnam	so	it	can	offer	practical	advisory	services
vietnam	economic	overview	khun	akesak	noted	that	vietnam	currently	has	population	of	million	and	that	most	people	own	mobile	phones
electronic	components	are	vietnams	main	export	product	accounting	for	usd	billion	in	growing	on	average	over	the	past	five	years
the	value	of	foreign	direct	investment	fdi	each	year	stands	at	about	usd	billion	with	most	fdi	going	to	the	manufacturing	and	export	sectors
thailand	is	vietnams	seventh	largest	trading	partner	behind	china	the	united	states	south	korea	the	european	union	and	japan	and	the	country	has	signed	free	trade	agreements	ftas	with	key	market	countries	across	the	world
moreover	more	than	half	of	its	population	are	young	workers	playing	an	important	part	in	driving	economic	growth	even	further
attractive	industrial	sectors	for	thais	energy	in	recent	years	most	of	the	thai	private	sector	has	invested	in	the	energy	segment	such	as	solar	farms	or	wind	farms
vietnam	energy	industry	has	grown	by	per	year	due	to	demand	for	more	energy	and	government	policy	calls	for	energy	production	to	double	within	ten	years
most	thai	investors	are	big	companies
manufacturing	investors	have	set	up	manufacturing	plants	for	domestic	markets	and	exports
free	trade	agreements	signed	with	key	economies	across	the	world	offer	strong	potential
other	favorable	factors	include	reduction	in	corporate	income	tax	stable	politics	and	plenty	of	quality	workers
retail	wholesale	vietnamese	consumers	have	high	purchasing	power	are	willing	to	spend	and	have	good	attitude	toward	thai	products	because	they	feel	they	are	of	good	quality	and	reasonably	priced	compared	to	korean	and	japanese	products
household	debt	remains	low
cac	vietnams	logistics	system	cac	vietnam	has	two	pick	up	points	at	ho	chi	minh	and	haiphong	ports
from	the	port	cities	the	company	operates	warehouses	equipped	with	modern	technology	to	efficiently	manage	supply	chains	and	cargo	from	its	main	warehouses	to	sub	warehouse
the	vietnamese	are	smart	and	quick	to	learn	and	have	adopted	technology	such	as	software	and	the	internet
personnel	management	must	involve	two	way	communication
one	way	top	down	communication	is	not	the	right	solution
cac	vietnam	employs	an	hr	team	of	both	vietnamese	and	thais	to	talk	with	and	engage	with	vietnamese	and	foreign	employees	finding	out	what	they	want	and	gathering	data	to	analyze	and	plan	training	to	upskill	them	for	their	future	career	paths
there	are	clear	performance	reviews	to	ensure	that	vietnamese	employees	understand	what	is	wanted
it	important	to	communicate	your	thoughts	and	policies
three	strategies	to	build	business	in	vietnam	khun	adisai	mentioned	three	strategies	he	adopted	to	pioneer	his	business	in	vietnam	products	must	meet	consumer	demands
don	assume	that	product	used	by	thais	will	be	successful	in	vietnam
the	vietnamese	market	has	its	own	identity	unlike	laos	and	cambodia
it	is	necessary	to	study	the	market	thoroughly	to	determine	what	consumer	groups	want	and	which	products	in	order	to	determine	marketing	plans	sales	packaging	and	prices
logistics	is	priority
vietnam	has	encountered	lot	of	problems	because	distribution	is	inefficient	due	in	part	to	its	large	geographical	area
vietnam	has	three	major	cities	namely	ho	chi	minh	south	hanoi	north	and	danang	central	and	the	behavior	of	people	in	each	region	is	different	and	independent	unlike	thailand	where	most	activities	are	centered	in	bangkok
access	to	consumer	behavior	and	logistics	plans	are	therefore	very	important
thai	businesses	often	fail	to	understand	the	habits	of	vietnamese	people
currently	the	cost	of	living	in	big	cities	is	similar	to	that	of	thailand
labor	intensive	businesses	should	look	for	provincial	areas	outside	big	cities
however	service	businesses	must	compete	using	online	marketing	with	sales	stationed	in	big	cities
businesses	should	not	expect	to	pay	less	than	they	would	in	thailand
vietnamese	workers	will	ask	clearly	about	their	compensation	and	the	benefits	they	will	receive	such	as	training	business	trips	field	trips	and	similar	things
if	they	do	not	receive	what	is	agreed	upon	they	will	leave
if	you	can	manage	this	issue	you	will	encounter	high	turnover	rate
four	precautions	for	new	investors	vietnamese	regulations	are	not	simple	and	the	government	enforces	strict	regulations	which	thai	entrepreneurs	often	neglect
if	investors	are	willing	to	comply	its	not	that	difficult
the	distance	between	vietnams	northernmost	to	the	southernmost	parts	is	km
with	its	road	system	still	having	problems	investors	must	plan	their	supply	chain	distribution	properly	as	they	have	to	consider	the	cost	of	bringing	products	into	and	out	of	the	area	and	understand	details	about	transportation	routes	bridges	etc
during	the	vietnamese	lunar	new	year	workers	will	take	day	leave	so	it	is	important	to	plan	workforce	and	supply	chain	issues	well
understand	the	fundamental	problems	of	vietnam
each	region	is	different	and	they	have	different	strengths	and	weaknesses
investors	must	understand	the	obstacles	and	challenges	of	each	area	before	entering	the	market	in	different	zones	such	as	the	southern	mekong	delta	tourist	cities	in	the	central	region	the	western	central	highlands	and	hanoi	haiphong	in	the	north
every	area	affects	the	selection	of	investment	and	distribution	points
amid	the	covid	situation	requiring	day	quarantine	sending	thai	employees	to	vietnam	is	difficult
therefore	investors	must	rely	on	good	partners	like	scb	to	help	follow	the	news	from	the	embassy
market	research	may	require	the	services	of	research	firms
don	even	think	about	investment	without	studying	first
khun	adisai	added	that	the	key	question	is	to	carefully	examine	yourself	to	see	if	your	business	is	suitable	for	this	country	or	not	such	as	ensuring	that	the	business	is	strong	enough	in	thailand	if	the	product	is	suitable	for	the	market	and	how	you	can	drive	the	business
business	will	take	time	to	succeed	and	we	must	explore	ourselves	clearly	to	determine	whether	or	not	we	are	meant	for	the	vietnamese	market
source	vietnam	trade	opportunities	after	the	covid	crisis	broadcast	on	facebook	on	march	to	make	your	overseas	business	uninterrupted	scb	international	branch	network	is	ready	to	support	and	provide	services
tiktok	the	chinese	social	media	that	has	overtaken	the	curve	in	this	era	has	given	some	governments	the	idea	of	banning	it	as	threat	to	national	security
while	some	users	view	tiktok	as	just	an	entertainment	platform	that	allows	users	to	create	funny	dance	clips	or	jokes
but	in	fact	if	you	do	deeper	study	tiktok	is	treasure	waiting	to	be	discovered	by	business	people	and	marketers
if	you	ve	learned	and	understood	correctly	about	this	chinese	social	media	platform	today	let	look	at	five	misconceptions	that	some	brands	are	not	interested	in	marketing	through	tiktok
number	tiktok	is	just	an	entertainment	platform	although	tiktok	was	initially	released	in	the	social	media	arena	the	world	was	mainly	focused	on	entertaining	users
but	in	fact	tiktok	has	few	tricks	that	can	create	strong	relationship	between	brands	and	customers	such	as	by	creating	challenges	for	customers	to	follow	cover	dance	music	products	or	by	engaging	customers	in	branded	campaigns
this	is	way	for	customers	or	followers	to	interact	with	the	brand
without	making	the	customer	feel	like	being	forced	by	the	brand	this	is	the	first	step	in	building	stronger	relationship	with	our	customers	in	the	future
number	tiktok	is	platform	for	young	people	of	course	the	early	users	that	tiktok	was	targeting	would	be	the	gen	group	so	many	brands	thought	tiktok	was	platform	for	kids
as	result	brands	with	target	audience	such	as	gen	may	immediately	ignore	tiktok	which	in	fact	its	users	today	have	expanded	even	more	not	just	in	the	gen	category
according	to	statistics	there	is	significant	increase	in	tiktok	usage	among	gen	if	you	look	at	the	statistics	of	some	countries	you	can	see	that	gen	is	using	tiktok	more	than	gen	such	as	china	indonesia	malaysia	saudi	arabia
the	united	arab	emirates
in	thailand	the	main	user	group	is	still	gen	but	above	all	business	people	and	marketers	should	not	be	overlooked
because	if	other	countries	use	gen	can	grow	thailand	has	chance	to	grow	as	well
number	tiktok	if	there	is	lot	of	followers	and	engagement	will	decrease	social	media	marketers	and	branders	are	often	familiar	with	traditional	social	platforms	like	facebook	where	if	they	have	high	fan	page	count	their	post	visibility	is	reduced	organic	reach	if	they	don	buy	ads
making	many	people	think	tiktok	will	be	the	same	in	fact	the	opposite	is	true	because	if	you	have	lot	of	followers	your	views	will	be	high	your	engagement	will	also	be	high	making	tiktok	has	better	performance	rate	compared	to	other	social	platforms
number	must	have	lot	of	followers	another	good	thing	that	tiktok	has	over	other	social	media	is	that	with	knowing	algorithms	user	insights	will	deliver	content	that	matches	their	interests	on	the	for	you	page
and	according	to	statistics	of	users	spend	more	time	on	for	you	pages	than	following	following	pages
it	shows	that	followers	do	not	influence	the	content	access	such	as	when	uploading	new	clips	the	system	will	only	be	shown	to	certain	users
by	looking	at	the	engagement	history	and	then	looking	at	how	many	people	stop	watching	liking	commenting	sharing	it	will	be	processed	to	continue	processing	whether	this	clip	should	be	shown	to	more	people	or	not
that	means	if	doing	good	content	that	satisfies	the	more	chances	that	the	system	will	show	results	to	others
you	don	have	to	have	lot	of	followers	just	do	your	content	well
the	chances	that	the	clip	will	become	viral	just	overnight	is	high
unlike	facebook	or	youtube	which	requires	many	fans	or	subscribe	to	have	more	opportunities	to	see
article	marketing	on	tiktok	must	only	dance
as	many	people	view	tiktok	as	the	only	entertainment	platform	tiktok	is	trying	to	expand	its	user	base
with	the	launch	of	the	tiktokuni	hashtag	to	increase	content	creation	in	useful	and	educational	way	to	the	tiktok	community
which	includes	examples	of	successful	creators	without	the	need	to	make	funny	dance	clip	in	any	way
for	example	year	old	teenager	in	new	york	has	made	over	math	and	math	clips	to	reach	more	than	followers
while	thailand	has	begun	to	have	users	of	tiktokuni	producing	variety	of	useful	short	video	clips	for	example	coach	bank	supakrit	teaches	professional	sales	techniques	with	over	hundred	thousand	likes
kimpropertylive	teaching	real	estate	techniques	with	over	likes	krujib_ebay	teaching	thai	products	to	foreign	countries	with	more	than	hundred	thousand	likes	drteamty	health	care	team	doctor	has	more	than	million	likes	jexep	jib	surasak	teaching	trendy	marketing	with	more	than	million	likes	kruhoneytv	teacher	honey	teaches	branding	with	over	hundred	thousand	likes
therefore	you	can	see	that	the	tiktok	market	in	thailand	is	beginning	to	have	new	creators	that	are	more	useful	and	have	variety	of	genres	to	choose	from	such	as	cooking	lessons	exercise	languages	editing	videos	cool	app	recommendations	how	to	guide	your	dream	career
such	as	flight	attendants	or	even	fortune	tellers	etc
it	is	worth	to	see	that	tiktokuni	will	be	able	to	expand	its	user	base	to	other	target	groups	besides	gen	in	thailand	or	not
businesspeople	and	marketers	must	stay	in	touch
on	top	of	all	that	don	forget	that	tiktok	is	now	platform	that	allows	users	to	be	user	generated	platform	that	has	already	surpassed	other	platforms
with	tiktok	hot	buzz	and	efforts	to	make	the	platform	more	than	just	entertainment	it	is	something	that	businesses	and	marketers	cannot	overlook	the	platform
because	if	you	are	complacent	the	golden	opportunity	to	sit	in	the	minds	of	the	younger	generation	may	not	be	able	to	catch	up

partnership	tech	company	nia	scb	innovation	based	enterprise	ibe	scb	sme	ceo	claim	di	co	ltd	sme	tech	company	partnership	tech	company	turning	from	sme	to	becoming	tech	company	khun	kittinan	tells	about	the	background	of	the	critically	acclaimed	experience	in	the	business	world	that	began	with	the	dotcom	era	twenty	years	ago
through	the	laundry	delivery	business	until	reaching	the	business	of	developing	programs	and	applications
like	the	insurance	claim	system	via	mobile	known	as	come	quickly	claim	quickly	with	customers	are	many	insurance	companies
slip	system	for	water	supply	anywhere	to	queue	system	queue	management	system	and	anywhere	er	ambulance	management	system	in	the	bangkok	hospital	network	etc
although	the	business	is	going	well	at	one	point	the	level	of	being	an	sme	leads	the	business	to	stalemate
because	system	development	can	be	copied	and	he	started	losing	customers	to	big	companies	that	specialize	in	system	development	in	the	same	way
khun	kittinan	realized	that	he	had	to	change	himself
what	makes	tech	company	different	from	sme	in	the	business	world	that	big	fish	eat	small	fish	in	order	to	kill	big	fish	it	must	be	quick	fish
khun	kittinan	spoke	about	the	idea	of	changing	himself	by	joining	the	telecom	grooming	company	in	which	made	him	completely	change	the	perspective	of	doing	business
previously	my	sme	business	model	was	to	sell	systems	to	customers
ecosystems	were	just	my	company	and	clients
seller	and	buyer	only	parties
but	for	the	tech	company	ecosystem	business	model	there	is	more	than	that
in	the	car	insurance	business	that	do	the	system	of	insurance	companies	ranges	from	government	marketing	management	board	department	policy	department	surveyor	accounting	and	customer	service
changed	my	view	from	just	selling	the	program	to	him	but	doing	the	job
that	makes	the	customer	understand	and	visualize	new	ecosystem
there	are	many	people	involved
the	tech	company	model	is	to	make	money	from	the	ecosystem	of	that	business
apart	from	the	concept	of	an	ecosystem	the	difference	between	sme	and	tech	company	is	the	partnership
entrepreneurs	can	look	for	new	partners
that	is	different	to	be	business	bond	and	making	more	money
who	are	the	tech	company	partnership
for	every	app	claim	di	is	partner	from	investor	from	telecom	company	which	is	the	first	partner
the	surveyor	company	is	the	second	partner
until	now	the	claim	di	claim	police	left	you	apps
that	khun	kittinan	pattana	becomes	partner	with	the	police
insurance	companies	nationwide	and	bangkok	hospital	network
and	has	expanded	to	make	alliances	with	insurance	companies	in	nigeria	and	singapore	as	well
and	key	partner	to	make	the	claim	di	app	known	to	consumers	is	line
claim	di	will	be	on	the	line	service	platform	to	over	million	users
everyone	is	partner
we	didn	take	money	from	him
but	taking	money	from	the	ecosystem
khun	kittinan	emphasized	that	every	tech	company	is	sme	but	every	sme	is	not	tech	company
if	you	do	not	aim	to	raise	funds	you	are	an	sme	not	tech	company
fundraising	doesn	just	mean	funding
but	being	an	affiliate	with	him	we	get	his	power
his	territory	is	considered	strategic	investor
kittinan	summed	up	the	tech	company	partnership	that	depends	on	the	life	stage
in	the	early	stage	entrepreneurs	would	like	to	manage	their	own	business	practices
we	will	want	to	spend	money	as	capital	only
later	at	the	seed	round	series	period	where	the	business	expanded	to	certain	point	must	have	partner	to	share	resources	to	help	grow	the	business
then	enter	the	growth	stage	after	series	onwards	at	the	cvc	corporate	venture	capital	from	large	companies	to	invest	in	the	tech	company
kittinan	views	that	the	tech	company	has	not	reached	the	growth	stage
and	having	joint	venture	with	cvc	is	likely	to	be	dominated	by	large	companies	build	good	ecosystem	and	deliver	strong	tech	company
good	ecosystems	are	contributing	to	the	growth	of	the	tech	company
many	sectors	fully	support	the	tech	company
for	example	scb	has	opened	an	open	platform	to	share	apis	for	tech	company	to	create	develop	new	business	ideas
government	agencies	like	the	national	innovation	agency	nia	also	have	program	to	support	the	tech	company	through	approaches	grooming	open	knowledge	by	nia	academy	startup	thailand	grant	open	innovation
to	distribute	funds	to	different	regions	and	growth	open	opportunity	supports	the	opening	of	foreign	markets

part	from	an	article	on	thailand	after	covid	prepare	to	get	through	the	economist	perspective	part	the	impact	of	the	economy	and	the	thai	labor	market
in	this	second	episode	let	look	at	how	the	heavily	affected	industries	must	go	forward	when	the	industry	recovers
what	kind	of	business	will	survive	in	this	period
how	does	new	normal	change	the	business
how	do	salaried	workers	need	to	re	skill
listen	to	the	views	of	economists	yunyong	thaicharoen	ph
first	executive	vice	president	of	economic	intelligence	centre	eic
who	will	bring	research	results	from	both	thai	and	foreign	countries	to	analyze	for	entrepreneurs	and	salaried	people	to	prepare	for	after	the	covid	crisis	ends
which	businesses	survive	fall	during	the	covid	period
from	the	economist	perspective	dr	yanyong	sees	that	every	crisis	has	chance
but	not	every	business	has	chance
must	look	at	what	businesses	can	grow	and	are	less	affected	by	covid
the	research	found	that	there	are	groups	which	are	communication	business	group	retail	groups	and	food	and	beverage	groups	must	be	done	both	online	and	offline	concurrently	because	people	are	getting	used	to	fast	and	easy	online	ordering
while	businesses	that	need	to	be	cautious	and	shouldn	be	rashly	affected	which	are	directly	affected	such	as	hotels	restaurants	airline	construction	and	real	estate	business	oil	business	and	automotive	business
these	are	risk	groups	that	should	be	cautious
but	not	able	to	do	business	must	wait	for	the	right	moment	after	the	rd	th	quarter	of	it	will	begin	to	see	gradual	but	gradual	recovery
dr	yanyong	said	that	should	try	to	learn	from	different	countries
in	crisis	you	can	see	that	there	are	some	similar	patterns
like	asia	the	survey	found	that	consumers	have	higher	demand	for	certain	types	of	fmcg	products	for	daily	use
resulting	in	stockpiling	of	goods	due	to	concerns	about	shortages
if	the	business	sector	must	stop	production	the	additional	products	purchased	include	personal	hygiene	products	health	products	and	supplements	and	household	cleaning	products	including	the	behavior	of	people	from	the	covid	situation
causing	of	online	shopping	using	video	streaming	services	and	of	ordering	food
while	the	products	that	buy	less	are	alcohol	drinks	luxury	goods	meat	and	seafood	including	fewer	behaviors	such	as	going	out	going	out	to	eat
or	in	the	united	states	there	is	also	trigger	point	that	allows	consumers	to	change	their	thinking	and	spending	behavior
by	focusing	on	more	necessary	things	such	as	food	and	medicine	with	proportion	of	purchases	increasing	by	more	than	and	online	shopping	habits
while	the	cost	reduction	would	be	in	tourism	including	entertainment	and	clothing	purchases	that	dropped	by	new	normal	familiarity	dr	yanyong	gave	comment	on	new	normal	to	the	behavior	of	people	who	change	because	of	the	habit	when	doing	that	behavior	repeatedly
in	long	time	have	chance	to	become	new	normal
but	not	every	behavior	will	become	all	new	normal
trends	of	consumer	spending	behavior	during	detention	at	home	such	as	watching	video	streaming	playing	online	games	spending	via	payment	ordering	food	delivery	cooking	food	at	home	including	spending	to	repair	the	house	such	as	furniture	renovate	the	house	into	home	office
these	new	behaviors	reflect	people	in	society
dr	yanyong	also	said	that	when	there	is	crisis	there	is	usually	new	normal
for	example	after	the	end	of	world	war	men	were	drafted	into	many	soldiers
causing	normally	women	only	stay	at	home	must	go	out	to	work	to	support	the	family	cause	new	normal
or	for	example	the	incident	with	terrorism	which	leads	to	more	stringent	flight	standards	for	terrorism	and	security
or	the	sars	crisis	causing	commerce	in	china	hong	kong	and	singapore	to	grow	because	people	must	shop	online
as	for	thailand	dr	yanyong	views	that	new	normal	will	be	matter	of	increasing	online	use	or	technology	in	various	matters
know	the	insight	techniques	to	bring	business	to	win	covid	with	questions	about	whether	to	start	new	business	or	not
dr	yanyong	views	that	the	business	after	covid	must	focus	on	the	rapidly	changing	consumer	behavior
understand	and	know	the	customer	mind	about	new	needs
must	improve	the	style	to	match	with	new	behavior
for	example	restaurants	believe	that	most	people	still	like	to	go	out	to	eat	at	restaurants	instead	of	taking	them	home	because	of	both	the	freshness	and	the	atmosphere	of	the	shop
but	must	also	be	sold	online
because	people	are	already	used	to	online	orders
or	the	mall	must	create	distinctive	spot	for	people	wanting	to	go	out	to	walk	in	the	mall
creating	better	experience	than	buying	online	will	also	allow	more	people	to	choose	to	walk	to	the	mall	etc
point	of	way	to	survive	the	hotel	business	the	covid	outbreak	has	caused	the	hotel	business	to	have	deep	cuts	that	are	difficult	to	heal	quickly
dr	yanyong	views	that	it	must	be	gradual	expected	around	the	middle	of	the	next	year	onwards
we	will	start	to	see	good	signs	because	of	the	turning	point	of	the	crisis	covid	means	that	the	vaccine	must	be	produced	successfully
the	hotel	business	will	improve	accordingly
and	how	to	adjust	during	this	period
the	first	thing	is	financial	management
must	closely	monitor	liquidity	manage	accrued	accounts	to	be	more	efficient	reduce	employment	costs	as	necessary	and	reduce	inventory
although	it	seems	that	the	hotel	business	takes	time	to	recover	dr	yanyong	suggests	that	business	people	should	not	be	stagnant	and	should	adapt	in	dimensions	namely	changes	in	service	standards	including	new	service	hygiene	in	terms	of	service	and	cleaning
more	guests	are	welcome	to	contactless	services
including	cleaning	rooms	and	areas	with	new	standards
digitalization	accelerated	guests	will	want	to	use	more	in	house	technology	to	reduce	intimate	contacts	such	as	the	mobile	check	in	system	or	the	concierge	system	used	to	book	various	services	within	the	hotel	requiring	more	investment	in	service	technology	than	before
increasing	revenue	flexibility	more	thai	guest	increases	the	proportion	of	income	for	thai	guests
do	not	rely	on	foreign	tourists	alone
allowing	more	flexibility	in	operations	in	the	event	of	abnormalities	in	the	future
non	room	revenue	increasing	revenue	from	other	services	such	as	spa	fitness	restaurant	and	conference	room	will	play	greater	role	in	hotel	operations	in	the	future
to	reduce	the	dependence	on	income	from	the	room	only	the	new	selling	point	golden	opportunity	of	course	the	situation	of	covid	makes	thailand	lack	of	tourism	income	accounting	for	percent	of	gdp
but	if	looking	optimistic	thailand	has	the	advantage	of	strength	in	medicine	and	public	health
dr	yanyong	sees	that	there	is	still	room	for	thai	tourists	to	come	back	to	thailand	after	visiting	covid	thai
due	to	being	renowned	for	medical	wellness	tourism
regarded	as	an	opportunity	in	the	medical	field	holistic	treatment	and	rehabilitation	including	local	cultural	tourism
travelers	who	like	to	travel	on	their	own	or	fit	free	and	independent	traveler	will	be	the	first	group	to	come	after	covid
it	is	therefore	an	opportunity	for	the	thai	tourism	industry	to	use	this	crisis	to	create	added	value	and	income	for	local	people
survival	of	salaryman	before	the	birth	of	covid	there	was	disruption	in	various	businesses
causing	the	business	model	to	be	adjusted
and	with	covid	it	was	the	catalyst	for	faster	disruptions
regarding	the	salaryman	dr	yanyong	said	that	the	first	thing	that	should	be	done	is	risk	management
which	must	have	liquidity	so	that	you	can	support	yourself	for	at	least	months	if	sudden	unemployment	occurs
should	reduce	expenditures	without	incurring	additional	debt	find	extra	income
and	during	confinement	at	home	should	invest	in	yourself	enhance	knowledge	add	new	skills	that	the	labor	market	needs
giving	you	more	chances	to	find	new	job	or	maybe	an	initiative	to	build	your	own	business	from	new	skills	learned
thai	entrepreneurs	that	have	been	affected	will	probably	see	the	new	normal	that	is	about	to	occur	in	thailand	after	the	covid	end
who	can	adjust	quickly
responding	to	new	consumer	needs	including	using	technology	to	create	business	opportunities	will	be	able	to	stand	and	survive
while	the	salaryman	has	an	opportunity	to	accumulate	knowledge	costs	add	new	skills	to	make	stronger	better	and	is	needed	by	the	labor	market	in	the	future
source	scbtv	thailand	behind	covid	prepare	to	get	through	the	perspective	of	an	economist	on	facebook	scb	thailand	may	for	sme
smes	are	the	lifeblood	of	the	thai	economy
employers	employ	more	than	of	the	country	in	the	face	of	the	covid	crisis	which	is	like	huge	iceberg	and	must	fight	against	economic	stagnation	can	sell	products	because	customers	lack	purchasing	power
plus	traditional	marketing	is	not	as	working	as	before
dr	ake	patthanakul	chair	of	the	master	in	branding	and	marketing	program	and	assistant	to	the	president	chulalongkorn	university	shared	experiences	and	turned	the	textbook	upside	down	to	find	strategies	to	help	thai	smes	survive	at	the	digital	sme	conference	thailand	when	thai	smes	are	facing	huge	iceberg	the	covid	crisis	caused	years	of	academics	who	taught	brand	and	marketing	at	the	faculty	of	accounting	dr	ake	to	tear	down	the	textbooks	he	had	taught	because	today	the	textbooks	are	no	longer	available
dr	ake	said	now	had	to	swallow	my	own	saliva
what	has	been	taught	in	the	past	no	longer	works
don	know	what	movement	to	use
as	in	the	past	it	would	teach	you	that	product	price	place	promotion	can	be	used	with	any	strategy	but	don	use	price
because	if	the	price	is	cut	back	and	forth	in	the	end	all	will	die
the	strategy	to	cut	the	price	will	only	make	the	product	value	lower	the	more	the	competition	is	the	lower
it	requires	strategy	to	create	value
create	added	value	for	the	brand
but	today	even	the	old	big	name	brands	still	must	cut	prices
because	people	don	have	money	today	value	marketing	can	do	it	and	must
cost	effective	marketing	for	example	five	star	hotel	spa	massage	baht	normal	massage	shop	baht	how	can	normal	massage	shop	survive
dr	ake	reiterated	that	what	he	said	did	not	make	the	operator	panic	but	want	the	businessman	to	realize	that	this	crisis	is	very	scary
every	marketing	textbook	must	be	torn	apart
you	must	think	of	an	upside	down
for	example	in	foreign	countries	famous	brand	companies	over	the	age	of	hundreds	must	shut	down	because	of	covid
in	thailand	itself	famous	tourist	attractions	airlines	restaurants	closed	many	hotels	are	still	not	open	because	there	are	no	tourists
and	how	to	continue	doing	business
today	we	must	find	solution	because	smes	that	have	been	around	for	long	time	both	overseas	and	in	the	country	still	cannot	survive	dr	ake	likens	the	covid	crisis	to	huge	iceberg	that	doesn	know	how	to	pass
he	recalled	the	latest	research	from	the	siam	commercial	bank	eic	center	for	economic	research	that	domestic	spending	was	negative	at
domestic	investment	negative	exports	negative	tourism	negative
the	only	positive	thing	is	the	amount	of	money	in	bank	where	more	than	one	hundred	million	baht	is	deposited	plus
that	means	rich	people	put	all	their	money	into	banks
the	question	is	if	thailand	is	like	car
but	no	engine	is	running	so	what	do	business	people	do
how	to	do	marketing	when	business	never	is	the	same
covid	distorts	marketing	and	business	practices
dr	ake	said	that	eight	months	ago	he	still	taught	that	the	sharing	economy	is	coming	but	now	everyone	is	afraid	of	covid
no	one	dares	to	share	anything
airbnb	uber	co	working	space	now	there	are	no	people	to	use	or	market	good	service	need	high	touch	service	but	it	is	the	fault	after	covid
or	gathering	of	tourism	that	requires	an	emphasis	on	interaction	eat	together	now	can
or	branding	requires	the	principles	of	sensory	branding	or	branding	through	the	five	senses	eyes	look	hand	touch	ears	listening	tongue	tasting	nose	sniffing
now	if	smes	use	the	same	method	taste	catch	smell	no	one	dares	to	do	just	two	things	the	eyes	and	the	traditional	simple	marketing	is	not	effective
identify	ways	to	survive	thai	smes	with	the	strategy	of	when	thai	smes	have	to	overcome	this	iceberg	but	the	traditional	marketing	strategy	is	unable	to	save	life	any	longer	dr	ake	asks	to	turn	the	marketing	textbook	to	be	the	light	to	point	out	the	solution	for	sme	entrepreneurs	with	the	strategy	methods
catch	the	current	what	current	to	seize	it	seize	it	first	if	making	it	possible	to	sell	products	dr	ake	said	that	in	the	past	the	market	caught	the	trend	saying	that	there	were	ups	and	downs	do	not	have	to	pay	attention	because	it	is	not	sustainable
but	now	if	there	is	no	budget	when	there	is	already	loud	current	hurry	and	catch	them	first	before	you	can	survive
when	there	is	new	trend	keep	looking
then	the	current	marketing	must	be	fast	what	happens	must	be	communicated	immediately	do	not	emphasize	beautifully
it	does	not	have	to	be	accurate	as	in	the	past
because	today	the	world	is	not	in	beauty	but	at	speed	or	fast
example	of	flow	that	comes	fast	super	valentine	orange	stop	raining	now	uncle	phon
dr	ake	noted	that	the	trend	will	happen	about	week	before	tiktok	followed	by	twitter	and	if	the	stream	is	going	to	go	to	ig	after	about	weeks	it	will	go	to	facebook	and	about	month	to	go	on	tv
therefore	smes	business	if	only	watching	tv	means	that	it	will	lag	for	months	or	play	line	alone	it	is	not	duty	to	do
today	must	keep	up	with	the	current
the	question	is	how	do	you	look	at	the	current
dr	ake	recommends	using	tool	like	google	trend	or	trend	wisesight	com	that	belongs	to	the	thai	people	and	understands	the	thai	context	well	so	that	they	can	follow	the	current	and	get	it	to	market
pecking	customers	customers	are	hard	to	find	no	money	to	buy	things	have	to	be	met	with	digital	tools	in	the	past	when	marketing	customer	pecks	would	not	do	because	of	fear	of	annoying	customers
but	today	customers	have	limited	money	if	they	don	buy	our	products	they	buy	other	people	stuff
so	you	need	to	follow	the	customers	pecking	techniques	that	are	simple	in	the	digital	world
for	example	when	you	talk	to	friend	about	product	you	re	interested	in	an	ad	suddenly	pops	up	on	facebook
when	interested	click	to	see	and	do	not	buy
ads	will	follow	indefinitely
maybe	cross	platform	as	well
dr	ake	asks	if	smes	have	been	marketing	this	kind	of	pecking	customers	yet
because	today	there	are	tools	like	facebook	pixel	or	google	tag	manager	that	can	enter	customer	information	and	follow	customers	indefinitely	until	they	buy	you	can	set	the	time	for	how	many	days	you	will	stick	to	customers
would	like	smes	to	do	their	homework	and	study	these	tools	and	must	use	them	as	they	will	be	very	useful	for	business
targeting	marketing	because	of	no	budget
need	to	find	customers	to	meet	clearly	target	customer	groups	dr	ake	recommends	that	there	is	marketing	method	that	does	not	require	large	budget	but	is	effective	because	it	can	find	potential	customers	through	targeted	techniques
just	know	how	to	search	for	groups	on	facebook	that	include	mothers	elders	health	lovers	pets	marketplaces	educational	institutions	etc
these	groups	have	huge	customers
there	are	similar	needs	ask	smes	to	try	to	search	for	example	facebook	group	the	mother	of	the	little	pig	club	is	the	mother	who	has	child	born	in	the	year	of	the	pig	come	together	to	share	experiences	with	each	other	or	the	elderly	group	go	to	count	up
with	over	people	aged	therefore	smes	must	hunt	for	those	groups
so	as	not	to	lose	the	opportunity	in	marketing	that	costs	less	but	is	very	effective
sincere	marketing	must	be	sincere
and	will	get	customers	back	in	the	past	we	had	to	create	brand	and	create	story	but	today	customers	have	learned	lot	about	what	is	true	and	what	is	not
sincere	marketing	doesn	have	to	be	online	alone
you	can	do	it	offline
for	example	big	tae	shop	at	thammasat	still	sells	well	even	with	convenience	stores	selling	competitions	but	still	selling
because	tae	sells	things	using	sincerity	plus	fun
with	handwritten	words	attached	to	the	shelf	such	as	bread	for	people	like	taro	or	recommended	snacks	at	the	end	of	the	month
crispy	corn	sticks	lot	delicious	only	baht
eat	the	whole	pack	and	drink	the	water	you	will	be	able	to	pass	this	month
or	brother	who	doesn	have	watch	to	wear	tae	would	like	to	recommend	hanami	rich	cracker	friend
here	is	an	example	of	handwritten	little	story	but	it	creates	sincere	and	touching	impression	on	the	customer
or	an	oyster	shop	cashes	seven	stamps	trend	oyster	sauce	baht	receive	stamp	of	seven	these	are	things	smes	can	do	and	big	brands	can	beat
try	to	apply	it	as	an	example	of	marketing	that	does	not	require	much	thought	but	is	the	sincerest
helping	society	today	everyone	is	struggling	business	can	live	and	society	can	live	because	covid	changes	society	everyone	is	afraid	because	they	don	know	what	will	happen	next
dr	ake	said	that	in	the	end	it	is	not	possible	to	do	business	alone	but	also	to	support	society
because	smes	are	people	who	employ	of	the	total	number	of	businesses	more	than	of	the	country
for	example	thai	post	office	in	the	past	many	people	sent	donations	to	the	hospital	so	there	was	promotion	for	free	delivery	if	the	weight	is	less	than	kilograms	the	post	will	be	picked	up	at	home
or	find	food	in	line	myshop	during	covid	farmers	do	not	sell	mangoes	together	with	elephants	lacking	food	so	they	brought	mangoes	and	elephants	to	meet	and	made	campaign	to	buy	kilograms	of	mangoes	for	the	elephants	to	help	the	farmers	help	the	elephants	make	agriculture	to	sell	mangoes
or	local	bkk	delivery	helps	the	community	is	gathering	of	the	sao	chingcha	community	and	the	pratu	pee	area	without	being	deducted	to	the	food	delivery	platform
living	business	concept	living	society	smes	can	be	used	because	it	will	make	the	business	stay	sustainable
before	the	end	of	the	session	dr	ake	reiterated	that	will	never	ever	be	the	same	again	nothing	is	the	same	today
many	people	think	that	covid	is	barrier	but	covid	is	an	opportunity	for	businesses	to	optimize	and	move	on
let	fight	together	source	digital	sme	conference	thailand	marketing	upside	down	upside	down	marketing	textbook	by	dr	ake	phatthanakul	chair	of	the	master	in	branding	and	marketing	program	and	assistant	to	the	president	chulalongkorn	university	september	for	sme
manpower	is	one	of	the	economic	factors
especially	in	the	present	world	that	most	parts	have	entered	the	digital	economy	and	are	driven	by	tech	companies	that	is	managed	by	the	new	generation	entrepreneurs	that	technology	is	an	important	part	of	the	business	through	various	digital	platforms
manpower	is	thus	key	to	the	development	and	growth	of	the	organization	especially	those	who	have	high	capability	called	talents	that	are	desired	by	many	organizations
but	where	to	find	those	talents	and	how	to	keep	them	with	the	organization
in	the	opening	ceremony	of	nia	scb	innovation	based	enterprise	ibe	assoc
prof	juthamas	kaewpijit	ph	director	of	leadership	management	and	innovation	programme	at	national	institute	of	development	administration	nida	and	talent	management	specialist	in	government	and	private	organisations	attended	the	discussion	panel	with	entrepreneurs	under	the	topic	talent	management	in	the	work	come	get	stay	concept
how	to	work	with	talent
assoc
prof	juthamas	said	that	according	to	the	global	research	it	shows	that	half	of	the	tech	and	start	up	companies	do	not	have	system	for	talent	management
talent	management	in	work	is	essential	and	there	are	often	questions	of	is	working	with	talents	difficult	or	can	talents	work	with	others	these	questions	might	be	hard	to	answer	if	we	do	not	know	about	the	individual	talents	well	enough
some	people	understand	the	meaning	of	talents	as	individuals	with	high	work	effectiveness	individuals	with	the	potential	to	complete	given	tasks	etc
therefore	working	with	capable	individuals	depends	on	how	well	we	understand	the	meaning	of	talent	know	what	talent	is	and	who	talents	are
talent	can	be	defined	in	ways	which	are	talent	as	attitude	an	individual	with	passion	and	motivation	that	makes	them	leader	who	is	ready	to	drive	the	organization	towards	success
talent	as	natural	ability	an	individual	who	is	gifted	since	birth	and	might	have	opinions	and	perspectives	that	differ	from	others
talent	as	mastery	an	individual	who	follows	the	motto	of	practice	makes	perfect
sometimes	when	unexpected	events	happened	this	kind	of	talent	will	appear
as	for	the	question	of	who	these	talents	are	assoc
prof	juthamas	said	that	it	can	be	viewed	from	aspects	which	are	talent	as	all	people	that	looks	at	every	single	individual	in	the	company	as	talents	or	talent	as	high	performers	and	high	potential	that	only	some	are	considered	talents
there	is	also	the	usage	of	box	grid	to	assess	the	individual	potential	to	further	support	them	for	example	individuals	with	high	potential	and	performance	are	classified	as	future	leaders	that	can	accomplish	whatever	tasks	are	given
for	those	with	high	potential	but	medium	performance	will	be	classified	as	impact	performers	that	have	the	tendency	to	grow	etc
thus	the	box	grid	is	screening	tool	to	look	for	ways	to	develop	talent	appropriately
future	leader	groups	can	be	developed	by	letting	them	work	in	new	situations	try	new	projects	and	try	to	make	decisions
the	second	group	is	growth	employees	that	can	be	developed	by	giving	them	stretch	assignments	to	upgrade	their	potential
average	groups	like	core	employees	will	have	to	be	developed	by	coaching	etc
the	keyword	of	creating	talent	is	growth	mindset	and	fixed	mindset	in	which	growth	mindset	is	crucial	in	developing	talent
nevertheless	we	need	to	know	what	type	of	talent	we	are	who	we	are	as	well	as	know	why	we	manage	talent
is	it	for	an	establishment	of	culture	creation	of	the	next	leaders	or	development	of	important	position	leaders
by	answering	all	these	questions	we	will	then	be	able	to	develop	and	keep	talents	as	well	as	set	the	working	pattern	of	talents	and	work	with	them
where	do	talents	come	from	and	how	to	get	them
organisation	can	find	talents	by	building	buying	or	borrowing
as	for	building	talents	cost	time	and	good	system	will	need	to	be	invested
assoc
prof	juthamas	mentioned	that	there	is	change	in	template	to	develop	talents	from	pattern	which	is	on	the	job	training	coaching	and	lecture	to	which	is	offline	training	and	online	training
another	pattern	is	which	is	learning	about	anything	relating	to	the	job	and	to	learn	anything	not	relating	to	the	job
in	the	case	that	talents	cannot	be	built	or	bought	we	can	borrow	them	from	organizations	or	entrepreneurs	that	we	are	close	to
when	looking	at	the	global	view	global	talent	competitiveness	index	gtci	is	serving	as	an	index	determining	the	search	for	talents	of	world	class	big	organizations
it	came	up	with	ranking	on	countries	that	talents	want	to	work	in	according	to	the	following	factors	factors	that	enable	talents	to	work	such	as	china	that	grants	privilege	to	talents	to	stay	in	place	called	unicorn	island	where	unicorn	start	ups	are	gathered	and	equipped	with	premium	facilities	that	are	convenient	for	living	factors	that	attract	talents	factors	that	allow	talents	to	grow	factors	that	retain	talents	together	with	the	efficiency	of	technical	vocal	skill	and	global	knowledge	skill	gtci	index	in	has	shown	that	thailand	is	ranked	in	the	world
how	to	make	talents	stay	in	the	organization
this	factor	is	the	arts	of	how	to	retain	talents	with	the	organization	as	long	as	possible
the	methods	range	from	rewarding	talents	with	what	they	want
talents	get	to	choose	their	reward
for	example	bringing	pets	to	the	workplace	getting	off	days	to	do	charity	etc
assoc
prof	juthamas	told	us	that	some	small	actions	that	show	care	to	employees	such	as	showing	gratitude	to	employees	when	they	help	us	during	hard	time	thanking	them	for	taking	care	of	us	fellow	colleagues	and	customers	sending	out	handwritten	thank	you	letters	are	very	easy	to	do	and	it	is	costless
we	should	start	doing	all	these	before	spending	on	other	things
talent	cost	or	an	investment
assoc
prof	juthamas	said	talent	can	either	be	viewed	as	cost	or	an	investment	because	in	reality	talent	is	human	cost
mixture	of	workforce	planning	and	human	cost
the	company	will	have	to	choose	who	and	when	to	invest
even	though	the	training	is	cost	if	organizations	look	at	it	as	an	investment	organizations	will	be	meticulous	with	training	evaluation	welfare	and	motivated	workforce
nonetheless	this	investment	to	develop	workforce	builds	talents	that	despite	one	day	they	left	the	organization	they	are	still	potential	materials	of	thailand	and	contribute	to	the	development	of	the	country
the	success	of	nia	scb	innovation	based	enterprise	ibe	programme	nia	scb	innovation	based	enterprise	ibe	programme	is	training	course	for	tech	company	entrepreneurs	at	the	national	innovation	agency	public	organization	or	nia	that	nia	and	scb	collaborated	together
there	are	more	than	companies	attended	the	week	training	in	the	first	batch
the	main	topics	are	such	as	business	management	marketing	branding	finance	etc
also	there	is	business	matching	with	sme	who	are	banks	customers	testing	ground	and	partnership	that	push	tech	companies	to	their	growth	stage	and	lead	to	business	expansion	allowing	them	to	compete	with	their	full	potential
also	real	success	happened	in	pairs	of	business	negotiations	and	there	are	deals	in	the	business	agreement
mrs	pikul	srimahan	senior	vice	manager	and	senior	manager	for	the	sme	segment	at	scb	congratulated	all	entrepreneurs	for	gaining	more	experience	from	attending	nia	scb	innovation	based	enterprise	ibe	programme
with	the	outbreak	of	pandemic	covid	the	worlds	situation	has	changed	at	an	extremely	fast	pace
scb	has	amended	the	working	pattern
more	than	of	employees	are	working	from	home	and	remain	at	the	bank
this	is	change	that	has	never	happened	to	scb	before
at	the	same	time	companys	technology	will	have	to	be	developed	faster	to	anticipate	the	changing	situation
whatever	that	was	deemed	impossible	is	now	possible
productivity	has	automatically	increased	as	well	as	the	availability	of	platforms	that	will	meet	customers	demand	such	as	blockchain	solution	for	procure	to	pay	that	scb	collaborated	with	big	companies	shared	with	other	organizations	and	managed	purchasing	systems	effectively
another	platform	is	robinhood	that	receives	tremendous	positive	feedback
apart	from	developing	technology	scb	also	welcomes	tech	companies	as	partners	on	the	platforms	with	open	arms
dr	krithpaka	boonfueng	deputy	executive	director	at	national	innovation	agency	public	organization	felt	that	as	nia	has	been	supporting	tech	companies	collaboration	with	scb	to	organize	ibe	program	helps	to	upgrade	potential	and	increase	the	opportunity	for	tech	companies
solution	producers	will	get	to	meet	with	sme	business	partners

ep	from	the	wuhan	china	covid	pandemic	which	was	quickly	spreading	and	the	chinese	government	decided	to	lock	down	the	whole	city	and	surrounding	cities	in	hubei	province	which	was	the	center	of	the	virus	outbreak	for	over	months
as	china	is	getting	better	these	days	they	are	the	first	encounter	solver	and	has	more	experience	than	the	others	so	what	have	we	learned	from	them
lets	find	out	from	the	chinese	business	experts	manop	sangiambut	executive	vice	president	for	chinese	business	at	scb	and	thanamon	sutheerapak	business	relation	manager	at	scb	shanghai	branch
what	happened	in	china	before	the	lockdown
china	reported	the	cluster	of	cases	of	pneumonia	in	december	where	it	was	not	that	panic	at	that	time	until	they	declared	the	lockdown	around	the	end	of	january	which	was	nearly	the	chinese	new	year
there	were	only	small	number	of	deaths	reported	but	manop	told	us	that	from	the	previous	chinese	experience	with	the	sars	epidemic	they	decided	to	assert	strict	and	immediate	measures	and	lockdown
the	government	announced	canceling	all	public	transportations	in	and	out	of	wuhan	where	over	ten	million	citizens	live	and	also	other	cities	in	hubei	province
although	outside	of	hubei	was	not	officially	closed	in	practical	way	it	does
the	entire	hubei	province	now	came	under	city	by	city	quarantine
furthermore	stay	at	home	restrictions	and	duration	are	declared	and	building	access	identification	is	needed	to	be	proofed	before	entering	any	residence
manop	has	been	working	in	chinese	business	for	over	years	and	became	the	person	who	started	the	chinese	scb	business
he	told	us	that	covid	chinas	lockdown	was	not	what	we	thought	it	could	happen	because	it	is	hard	to	predict	the	effect	of	billion	chinese	citizens	is	staying	home
however	the	who	forecast	that	the	chinese	lockdown	would	help	slow	the	spreading	around	month	and	give	some	time	for	other	country	preparation
this	is	the	important	thing	that	every	country	leader	needs	to	act	immediately	to	prepare	respond	and	recover
how	do	people	change	during	the	lockdown
as	thanamon	has	worked	at	scb	shanghai	branch	for	months	she	told	us	that	there	was	rumor	spreading	before	the	chinese	new	year	and	then	it	was	getting	wider	after	the	festival
she	was	living	in	shanghai	at	that	time	and	it	was	one	of	the	places	that	had	implemented	temperature	measurement	everywhere
it	was	bit	nervous	at	first	but	after	watching	the	news	she	started	to	prepare	herself	for	any	situation	and	understand	these	important	practical	ways	as	following	the	chinese	government	has	implemented	the	stay	at	home	restrictions	to	help	control	the	number	of	covid	cases
the	medical	support	to	recover	patients	as	soon	as	possible
also	they	decided	to	immediately	start	building	new	hospitals	in	wuhan	to	admit	covid	patients
more	than	healthcare	workers	were	deployed	and	medical	resources	were	mobilized	from	across	the	country	to	support	and	study	to	improve	immunity	by	herbs
furthermore	the	announcement	of	emergency	ambulances	would	take	any	sick	people	and	take	good	care	to	ensure	that	if	anything	happens	the	government	will	take	care	of	them	so	they	want	to	collaborate	with	the	government	and	stay	home
is	there	any	shortage	of	consumable	products
it	is	normal	in	china	that	they	tend	to	not	use	cash	anymore	or	almost	become	completely	cashless	society
for	daily	life	such	as	grocery	shopping	or	any	flesh	they	can	order	pay	online	and	soon	the	product	will	be	delivered	to	their	doors
this	makes	chinese	people	did	not	feel	too	inconvenient	and	when	any	crisis	happens	everyone	wants	to	collaborate	with	each	other
thanamon	told	us	that	all	of	these	things	make	china	great	country	and	can	easily	go	through	any	crisis
big	data	and	online	platform	vs	covid	pandemic	china	is	cashless	society	so	every	financial	transaction	is	on	mobile	application	which	helps	china	overcome	this	covid	crisis
in	the	past	china	had	developed	many	technologies	including	big	data	which	have	played	big	role	in	everyone	daily	life
chinese	applications	are	designed	to	cover	all	daily	essentials	via	qr	code
for	example	alipay	wechat	or	unionpay	application	payment	and	we	can	track	the	risk	of	our	activity	at	each	covid	spreading	area	such	as	is	there	an	outbreak	in	the	area	that	we	bought	an	airline	or	train	ticket
this	information	is	related	to	each	other	so	the	chinese	government	has	collaborated	with	the	private	sectors	to	develop	the	health	code	function	based	on	these	data	which	contributes	to	tracking	and	decreasing	the	infection	risk
health	code	generates	green	safe	yellow	outside	travel	or	red	risk	and	no	quarantined	outside	travel
there	is	health	code	checking	at	every	place	and	will	let	only	the	green	code	enter
from	this	point	manop	told	us	that	qr	code	is	the	function	in	every	application	and	luckily	china	has	developed	many	technologies	with	big	data	and	during	the	covid	period	they	have	applied	them	effectively	to	their	people	daily	life
what	is	the	rising	business	during	covid	pandemic
from	his	expertise	in	chinese	business	manop	thought	that	the	fastest	growing	industry	is	the	online	platform	business	such	as	the	online	society	platform	which	shows	the	increasing	number	significantly
there	were	only	big	companies	which	are	the	first	ranking	tencent	and	alibaba	as	the	second
currently	bytedance	the	owner	of	tiktok	has	become	the	second	place	instead	of	alibaba	because	of	the	rising	number	of	users	and	usage	hours
the	overall	online	society	rating	is	boosting	also	the	commerce	business	which	took	place	only	of	whole	retail	business	but	in	this	covid	situation	it	has	expanded	over	and	will	certainly	reach
for	online	study	business	and	online	tutor	such	as	learning	application	which	is	normally	widely	used	however	in	this	covid	pandemic	the	usage	numbers	have	been	dramatically	increased
also	zoom	the	online	meeting	program	has	been	widely	used	in	china	although	it	is	not	the	chinese	application	nonetheless	it	is	only	few	applications	that	are	allowed	to	be	used	in	china
for	online	study	business	and	online	tutor	such	as	learning	application	which	is	normally	widely	used	however	in	this	covid	pandemic	the	usage	numbers	have	been	dramatically	increased
also	zoom	the	online	meeting	program	has	been	widely	used	in	china	although	it	is	not	the	chinese	application	nonetheless	it	is	only	few	applications	that	is	allowed	to	be	used	in	china
manop	thought	that	online	business	had	existed	before	the	covid	but	no	one	was	interested
since	the	covid	pandemic	happened	and	everybody	had	to	stay	home	and	had	more	time	to	utilize	these	online	applications	such	as	the	tiktok
we	can	say	that	the	crisis	made	us	see	surrounding	things	clearer	and	accelerated	the	survival	adjustment
for	example	the	elderly	who	tend	to	use	cash	but	need	to	change	and	learn	how	to	pay	via	an	application
the	covid	pandemic	in	china	is	both	crisis	and	an	opportunity

when	the	word	metaverse	was	mentioned	by	mark	zuckerberg	founder	of	giant	social	platform	the	whole	world	turned	to	what	it	was
how	does	it	relate	to	our	lives
chanon	traising	senior	software	engineer	scb	co	ltd	will	share	the	story	of	the	metaverse	world	from	its	inception	to	the	present
and	explore	the	technologies	and	business	opportunities	that	come	with	this	new	world
what	is	metaverse
the	term	metaverse	has	been	around	for	long	time	but	it	became	more	popular	late	last	year	that	facebook	changed	its	name	to	meta	which	means	metaverse	meaning	the	physical	world
which	is	not	just	playing	games	alone
but	going	to	live	meet	people	work	etc	is	virtual	world	that	is	parallel	to	the	real	world
mark	zuckerberg	sees	the	metaverse	to	connect	with	people	more	than	just	typing	posting	photos	and	videos	on	facebook	but	going	into	another	world	and	meeting	people
it	was	realistic	experience	that	was	different	from	what	it	is	today
the	metaverse	is	therefore	matter	of	social	connection	and	immersive	experience
still	in	the	initial	stage	many	companies	have	come	to	research	and	experiment	which	has	resulted	in	clearer	picture	of	the	metaverse	world
chanon	said	that	the	metaverse	world	has	evolved	over	decades
in	the	early	days	it	was	very	similar	to	game	called	single	narrow	experience
the	next	era	when	the	internet	thus	online	games	such	as	raknarok	were	born	where	people	played	games	together	as	multi	experiences	around	one	game	mechanics
in	the	rd	generation	the	concept	of	user	defined	experiences	develops	from	the	original	online	games	to	have	more	diverse	experiences	for	example	roblox	has	selling	point	that	gives	creators	the	tools	to	create	games	on	the	platform	on	roblox
huge	variety	of	games
in	modern	times	there	was	question	that	in	addition	to	being	game	can	the	virtual	world	does	more	than	that
many	businesses	began	to	think	more	than	games
bringing	the	concept	of	new	economy	in	virtual	space
the	technologies	that	make	up	the	metaverse	world	can	be	divided	into	two	groups
the	first	group	is	experience	which	is	the	easiest	to	access	by	users	and	the	inner	group	called	infrastructure
it	is	the	technology	behind	the	metaverse	world	such	as	internet	speed	blockchain	nft	etc
for	blockchain	it	is	one	of	the	technologies	that	help	the	ecosystem	of	metaverse	to	collect	data	in	various	nodes	scattered	around	the	world
we	have	ownership	of	the	data
the	platform	does	not	have	the	right	to	own	the	data
will	not	be	able	to	edit	or	delete	the	data
as	for	non	fungible	tokens	nft	non	tradable	assets
no	matter	how	similar	they	are	such	as	art	where	the	original	and	the	reproduction	have	different	values
blockchain	technology	adopts	the	non	fungible	token	feature	that	when	any	asset	is	created	on	the	blockchain	everyone	created	has	unique	blockchain	id	it	can	be	tracked	how	many	assets	it	is
who	owns
currently	nft	is	used	in	art	bringing	nft	to	exchange	for	real	products	and	services	redeemable	and	using	nft	as	tickets	to	various	events
solve	the	problem	of	fake	cards	sold	overpriced	because	nft	can	check	all	the	information
various	game	items	purchased	our	in	game	assets	can	be	traded	and	built	on	other	games
even	the	current	game	is	closed
as	for	experience	seeing	the	world	metaverse	has	main	technologies	augmented	reality	ar	allowing	users	to	see	the	digital	world	overlaid	with	the	real	world	through	glasses	mobile	screens	such	as	pokemon	go
virtual	reality	vr	will	as	opposed	to	ar	when	wearing	vr	headsets	it	enters	the	digital	world
mixed	reality	xr	mixtures	between	ar	and	vr	that	are	in	the	real	world	can	interact	with	the	digital	world
out	of	these	technologies	there	will	be	vr	headset	as	an	important	device
it	is	predicted	that	more	people	will	use	vr	in	the	future
and	vr	glasses	have	been	developed	to	have	variety	of	functions
more	realistic	displays	such	as	hand	tracking	retina	resolution	face	eye	tracking
currently	metaverse	platforms	are	divided	into	main	groups	based	on	core	technology	functions	blockchain	group	has	decentralized	selling	point
ownership	trade	digital	assets	nfts	across	platforms	use	tokens	trade	in	metaverse	like	the	sandbox	decentraland	cryptovoxels	somnuim	space
social	groups	focusing	on	interactions	between	people	realistic	like	talking	to	real	people	such	as	zepeto	horizon	worlds	facebook	metaverse	vr	chat	recroom	game	group	focuses	on	fun
it	is	game	that	allows	creators	to	create	business	related	experiences	on	platforms	such	as	roblox	minecraft	fortnite
opportunity	to	expand	your	business	in	the	metaverse	world	chanon	mentioned	that	by	the	metaverse	market	will	grow	to	more	than	trillion
and	it	is	seen	as	new	opportunity	that	many	businesses	want	to	try	new	things	in	the	world	of	metaverse	where	gen	and	gen	groups	are	the	main	force	that	will	drive	metaverse	easier
in	addition	from	the	fact	that	metaverse	was	born	during	work	from	home	which	from	the	management	point	of	view	that	there	is	pain	point	in	creating	an	organizational	culture	the	metaverse	gather	town	horizon	workrooms	technology	has	been	adapted	to	meet	the	interactions
with	people	and	metaverse	also	enhances	the	collaborative	experience	with	others	to	watch	entertainment	such	as	live	concerts	sports	movies	in	an	immersive	atmosphere
for	scb	has	invested	in	the	sandbox	and	has	developed	head	office	in	metaverse	divided	into	zones	past	present	and	future	reflecting	the	image	of	thailand	from	the	past	to	the	future
emphasis	on	usefulness	in	areas	virtual	hub	organizes	technology	knowledge	sharing	events	create	participatory	experience	virtual	land	for	business	partners	to	carry	out	activities	to	build	on	the	project	and	nft	gallery	an	exhibition	and	concert	space
support	thai	artists	to	the	world	market	there	are	many	new	opportunities	with	the	metaverse	world	waiting	for	us	to	discover
are	we	ready	for	the	new	world	yet

thailand	is	still	popular	among	chinese	people	over	japan	and	other	southeast	asian	countries
viewed	from	the	last	chinese	new	year	period
chinese	also	come	to	visit	thailand	the	most

the	trend	can	be	fit	free	independent	traveler	or	local	tour	purchase
therefore	marketing	must	focus	on	grouping	fit	more	than	before	with	the	market	group	tourists	only	on	average	chinese	tourists	spend	days	traveling	in	thailand
if	coming	days	they	will	travel	to	only	one	city	like	phuket	bangkok	chiang	mai

online	financial	director	business	through	fingertips	it	is	popular	choice	in	every	country	including	vietnamese	people

access	to	fintech	services	and	wallets
however	with	the	rapid	growth	there	are	many	challenges	that	internet	banking	service	providers	in	vietnam	are	preparing	to	cope	with
internet	banking	services	in	vietnam	many	banking	operators	have	adopted	technology	to	apply	more	in	financial	related	businesses

away	from	the	covid	event	even	though	it	is	highly	competitive	and	challenging	business	in	many	areas
but	there	are	still	some	interesting	opportunities	for	this	business
while	on	the	other	hand	banks	in	vietnam	have	fierce	competition	for	market	share	from	consumers
due	to	the	change	in	consumer	behavior	due	to	the	covid	crisis	as	well	as	the	ever	increasing	population	expected	to	reach	million	people	in	the	next	few	years
these	factors	have	led	to	rapid	increase	in	mobile	banking	transactions

cross	country	freight	forwarding	in	southeast	asia	has	become	viral	discussion	topic	in	terms	of	the	economic	aspects	involved
although	the	china	laos	railway	mega	project	connecting	the	lao	pdr	capital	of	vientiane	and	kunming	in	southern	china	has	been	widely	hailed	for	being	new	option	for	shipping	goods	from	china	to	europe	it	should	not	be	overlooked	that	vietnam	is	now	offering	cross	country	freight	service	to	europe	as	well
the	prevalence	of	the	delta	variant	of	the	covid	pandemic	in	vietnam	triggered	lockdown	measures	in	key	cities	such	as	ho	chi	minh	hanoi	da	nang	and	others	which	are	all	home	to	companies	producing	famous	brands	from	all	over	the	world
shutdowns	delayed	industrial	processes	and	restricted	mobility	producing	shortages	of	raw	materials
transporting	goods	to	global	markets	by	trucks	and	ships	generated	traffic	congestion	and	the	inspection	of	commodities	crossing	borders	took	longer	than	it	did	in	pre	covid	days
against	the	backdrop	of	these	setbacks	on	july	vietnams	rail	transport	and	trade	joint	stock	company	ratraco	subsidiary	of	vietnam	railways	together	with	shipping	businesses	from	other	nations	experimented	with	the	first	freight	train	from	yen	vien	railway	station	in	hanoi	to	liege	in	belgium
containers	will	subsequently	be	further	transported	to	rotterdam	in	the	netherlands	by	truck
the	first	train	contained	shipments	of	textiles	shoes	and	electronic	equipment
the	first	freight	train	to	europe	from	vietnam	went	smoothly	and	took	around	days	almost	half	the	time	typically	involved	in	shipping	goods	by	sea	from	vietnam	to	europe
in	addition	to	being	quicker	it	also	helps	solve	the	problem	of	labor	and	container	shortages	at	ports
currently	vietnam	railways	is	continuing	to	develop	its	services	to	carry	commodities	from	vietnam	to	other	nations	in	conjunction	with	china	railways	which	supplied	financial	support	and	empty	containers	for	this	project
it	also	assists	in	providing	international	freight	forwarding	to	china	europe	russia	central	asia	and	southeast	asia
however	vietnam	international	freight	service	via	rail	still	has	limitations	in	terms	of	the	size	of	its	warehouses	accommodating	operations	twice	week	which	are	small	compared	to	the	lao	china	railway	line
but	it	is	no	less	interesting	alternative	and	nobody	can	dispute	that	rail	is	beginning	to	play	vital	part	in	the	region	transit	network	further	connecting	southeast	asia	to	the	world	in	the	near	future

it	is	railway	route	connecting	laos	pdr	and	china	for	internal	routes
laos	pdr	is	railway	line	project	since	and	was	completed	at	the	end	of	the	internal	route	in	china	starts	from	kunming	and	ends	at	mauhan	or	the	city	of	bohan	located	in	southern	china	and	connected	to	the	shore	laos	pdr	at	boten
the	train	running	on	this	route	is	bullet	train	with	average	speed	of	km
which	can	run	on	flat	road	at	maximum	speed	of	km	and	running	on	the	hill	at	speed	of	km	there	are	convoys	together	namely	lan	xang	parade	which	means	lot	to	laos	pdr	because	it	is	the	name	of	the	kingdom	that	used	to	be	the	great	capital	of	pdr
laos	in	the	past	and	another	train	named	kaen	lao	for	the	color	of	the	train	consists	of	red	white	and	blue	which	is	the	national	flag	of	laos	pdr
it	is	the	pride	of	the	lao	people
on	december	nd	the	national	day	of	lao	pdr	the	official	launch	of	the	electric	train	in	laos	pdr	which	in	the	beginning	due	to	the	situation	of	covid	still	not	trustworthy
therefore	the	service	is	only	available	for	passengers	traveling	within	the	country	and	transport	only
when	the	situation	becomes	better	it	will	serve	international	passengers

chemico	group	is	an	importer	and	distributor	of	high	quality	chemicals	raw	materials	for	cosmetics	home	care	food	dietary	supplements	flavoring	additives	health	beauty	instrument	including	laboratory	appliances	and	laboratory	testing	services
we	are	talking	to	khun	prasop	palakornkitti	managing	director	of	chemico	inter	corporation	co	ltd	about	his	journey	to	lead	chemico	group	to	the	regional	leader	of	the	chemicals	business
challenge	in	the	foreign	market	chemical	group	was	established	in	and	has	achieved	tremendous	success	in	years	based	on	khun	prasops	vision	with	his	precise	analysis	in	the	chemicals	industry	market	creating	professional	sales	team	with	basic	knowledge	of	chemistry	and	expanding	chemico	group	to	international	markets	as	there	is	more	business	opportunity
over	years	ago	most	local	manufacturers	in	southeast	asian	countries	had	little	know	how	about	chemicals	comparing	to	more	advanced	countries	like	thailand
at	that	time	there	was	market	potential	such	as	high	purchasing	power	and	large	number	of	populations	in	indonesia	million	philippines	and	vietnam	million	etc
khun	prasop	shared	with	us	his	time	when	pioneering	the	business	overseas
in	the	first	phase	from	the	business	was	launched	together	in	countries	namely	indonesia	the	philippines	vietnam	and	malaysia
the	market	in	general	at	that	period	was	not	quite	productive	due	to	the	economic	crisis
anyway	khun	prasop	viewed	that	as	an	opportunity	to	enter	foreign	markets	while	others	dared	not	to
however	challenge	of	marketing	overseas	was	not	market	development	but	the	regulations	of	destination	countries	that	limited	foreign	investment	by	prohibiting	foreign	investors	from	making	the	full	investment
we	had	to	joint	venture	with	local	partner
unfortunately	all	local	partners	faced	problems	so	we	were	unable	to	develop	the	market	at	our	full	potential	and	had	to	change	the	shareholder	structure	later	said	khun	prasop
stepping	up	to	be	regional	leader	in	the	chemicals	beauty	industry	even	though	the	business	in	overseas	markets	was	not	successful	at	first	khun	prasop	did	not	give	up	his	goal	to	drive	chemico	group	to	grow	at	regional	level
new	opportunity	came	when	many	countries	started	making	changes	to	regulations	about	foreign	investment
in	vietnam	was	lenient	toward	the	rules	to	welcome	foreign	investors	at	full	scale
consequently	chemico	group	returned	to	vietnam	for	investment	by	starting	to	joint	venture	with	japanese	partners	at	the	ratio	of	later	in	when	disagreement	in	management	occurred	both	partners	decided	to	close	down	the	old	business	and	opened	new	company	under	the	name	of	chemico	vietnam	co	ltd	and	chemico	group	owned	shareholder
apart	from	success	in	vietnam	as	the	law	was	more	released	and	chemical	group	had	full	management	authority	more	achievement	was	in	indonesia	philippines	malaysia	including	myanmar	india	and	russia	which	were	just	launched	over	years	ago
currently	chemico	group	has	affiliates	in	countries	with	offices	in	indonesia	at	jakarta	and	surabaya
raise	strength	in	health	beauty	specialist	another	successful	factor	of	chemico	group	is	the	strategies	to	boost	marketing	strength	by	emphasizing	quality	laboratories	with	technical	expertise	to	support	customers	in	variety	of	processes	such	as	create	product	formulas	verify	products	provide	consult	for	customers	etc
khun	prasop	places	strong	importance	on	the	laboratory	while	some	other	chemical	companies	do	not
he	believes	that	owning	laboratory	is	to	create	value	to	the	business	more	than	just	trading	and	it	is	also	strong	point	that	enhances	customers	to	be	partner	with	chemico	group
at	present	almost	all	chemico	group	affiliates	except	russia	own	the	laboratories	with	over	technicians
more	importantly	chemico	group	has	been	raised	to	be	the	leader	in	health	beauty
the	chemical	asia	health	and	beauty	center	cahb	is	built	on	square	meters	space	as	the	center	for	health	and	beauty	technology	in	asia	with	many	experts	who	have	developed	product	formulas	and	arranged	training	to	provide	full	support	for	customers
create	your	own	opportunity	the	covid	pandemic	has	significant	impact	on	business	widely
as	the	chemicals	products	of	chemico	group	are	specialty	products	they	are	in	high	demand
even	though	the	number	of	beauty	products	is	decreased	because	the	partners	cant	export	them	to	european	markets
the	beauty	instrument	used	in	the	beauty	clinic	business	has	also	experienced	that	effect	due	to	the	lockdown	policy	while	food	and	dietary	supplements	are	growing	and	that	has	made	total	sales	slightly	decrease
while	most	businesses	get	stuck	during	the	lockdown	chemico	group	doesnt	waste	its	time	but	finds	an	opportunity	to	put	hard	effort	into	the	function
we	have	created	over	formulas	for	new	beauty	and	cosmetic	products	as	preparation	for	supporting	customers
we	will	be	ready	to	enter	the	markets	after	the	covid	disappears	said	khun	prasop
for	future	plans	chemico	group	will	develop	more	commerce	platforms	to	add	communication	channels	for	customers	through	social	media	including	facebook	youtube	and	line
financial	support	from	business	partners	as	chemico	group	has	certain	amount	of	budget	the	company	needs	support	from	financial	institution	to	be	able	to	expand	its	business	overseas
chemico	vietnam	co	ltd	cmv	at	ho	chi	minh	branch	is	the	scb	customer	in	both	revolving	limit	and	currency	buying	to	protect	against	the	risk	of	currency	fluctuation

customers	who	are	interested	in	operating	business	in	clmv	or	great	mekong	subregion	gms	comprising	cambodia	laos	myanmar	and	vietnam	scb	has	overseas	affiliates	to	support	and	service	you

scb	overseas	branch	network	is	ready	to	support	and	provide	services
if	country	economic	system	is	like	human	body	smes	are	like	blood	vessels	that	help	nourish	the	body	to	survive
but	whenever	blood	vessel	clogs	it	will	inevitably	affect	the	body	system
scb	recognizes	the	importance	of	sme	entrepreneurs
therefore	we	have	organized	an	online	training	program	the	dots	digital	commerce	to	help	strengthen	the	potential	of	thai	smes
and	have	shield	against	the	competition	in	world	without	borders	ready	to	sharpen	weapons	with	online	marketing	strategies	to	face	new	challenges	in	the	digital	era	with	mr	pikul	srimahan	senior	executive	vice	president	chief	executive	officer	sme	business	group	of	siam	commercial	bank	spoke	at	the	opening	of	this	training	program	course
why	is	growth	mindset	important	to	smes
developing	new	skills	and	knowledge	in	business	it	is	something	that	sme	entrepreneurs	must	constantly	learn
always	train	yourself	to	be	able	to	keep	up	with	the	new	world	with	technology	as	an	indicator	of	who	will	win	or	lose	in	this	game
pikul	said	people	who	are	sme	entrepreneurs	must	have	the	degree	business	knowledge	and	must	also	have	growth	mindset	especially	looking	at	saw	an	opportunity	not	giving	up	on	the	obstacles	in	front	of	you
especially	now	that	our	lives	are	inevitable	with	technology
because	technology	will	be	the	main	weapon	that	helps	smes	to	survive	disruption	therefore	understanding	online	sales	on	the	platform
it	is	very	important	to	use	technology	to	reduce	costs	and	use	data	to	know	the	real	customers	how	does	large	person	support	small	person
based	on	the	importance	of	smes	scb	views	that	the	bank	main	function	in	addition	to	providing	loans	for	business	capital	still	wanting	to	be	business	partner	shake	hands	with	smes	so	that	they	can	move	on	especially	in	times	of	crisis	that	need	help	if	smes	can	survive	banks	can	go	on	either
therefore	this	is	the	source	of	the	training	project	to	help	smes	to	be	able	to	walk	the	business	game	to	the	online	road
through	an	intensive	week	course	more	than	trainees	will	adapt	their	thinking	methods	and	strategies	for	entering	the	digital	battlefield
the	bank	acts	as	an	intermediary	connecting	each	dot	to	form	powerful	line
to	lead	the	thai	economy	through	the	crisis	and	become	global	trade	arena
pikul	said	the	bank	sees	that	helping	smes	become	stronger	in	this	era
need	to	reduce	costs	effectively
as	such	the	bank	invests	in	creating	platform	to	help	small	people	have	an	ecosystem	to	do	business	and	be	free	to	compete
robinhood	for	example	is	intent	on	helping	food	businesses	to	have	an	online	storefront	without	paying	any	fees	or	gp	fees
while	ecosystem	stakeholders	such	as	the	ryder	group	are	employed	robinhood	will	expand	its	services	to	local	hotel	chains	over	the	next	year
thus	there	is	channel	to	sell	rooms	on	the	platform	without	having	to	pay	fee
in	addition	the	bank	also	has	scb	trade	club	platform	to	help	entrepreneurs	import	export
able	to	trade	products	in	every	corner	of	the	world	along	with	collecting	trade	information	documents	as	well	as	being	medium	for	matching	partners	from	around	the	world	helping	the	import	export	business	able	to	spread	its	wings	farther	than	before	there	is	also	fee	free	money	transfer	system	that	helps	smes	get	convenience	and	speed
including	joining	hands	with	partners	to	introduce	business	help	to	smes	such	as	platform	to	help	online	sellers	to	store	pack	deliver	goods
resulting	in	cost	savings	and	efficient	stock	management	etc
it	can	be	seen	that	the	role	of	the	bank	is	not	only	the	lender
but	will	be	like	true	friend	who	is	ready	to	walk	beside	passing	on	success	to	thai	smes	to	grow	strong	without	limits	master	key	flip	sme	handicap	pikul	reiterated	that	as	for	technology	it	inevitable
when	inevitable	have	to	face	would	like	to	say	that	the	secret	that	makes	business	lose	or	win	is	at	the	cost	if	smes	know	how	to	use	technology	to	help
it	will	bring	enormous	benefits	to	businesses	from	using	technology	such	as	when	sme	entrepreneurs	question	whether	the	bank	uses	data	as	information	for	lending	decisions	usually	online	sellers	who	accept	cash	will	not	be	able	to	pay	taxes
but	when	taking	the	income	through	the	bank	the	irs	will	know	how	much	the	real	income	is
how	do	adjust
pikul	replied	normally	customer	information	cannot	be	disclosed	because	it	is	considered	confidential
but	want	you	to	look	at	it	in	reverse
paying	taxes	correctly	will	help	smes	to	recognize	the	true	cost	of	profits	in	the	business
and	should	not	be	afraid	of	paying	taxes	should	find	solution	that	if	you	have	to	pay	tax	how	to	do	it	as	little	as	possible
plus	the	advantages	of	receiving	money	through	banks	sellers	also	get	data	that	can	be	used	for	cost	management	or	collecting	statistics	on	product	sales	as	well
most	importantly	it	will	make	it	easier	to	borrow	money	to	expand	your	business
because	the	bank	saw	all	the	data	finally	pikul	concluded	today	smes	must	adapt	and	have	strong	passion	if	they	want	to	survive
had	to	find	gap	to	find	find	the	difference	and	your	own	identity	has	to	change	quickly	and	make	yourself	lighter	that	is	the	sme	survival	technique	of	this	era	that	pikul	has	left	for	us

in	an	era	that	entrepreneurs	need	data	to	develop	their	business	some	might	have	question	of	what	will	come	next	after	data	collection	how	to	analyze	information	and	how	much	data	needed	to	be	collected	to	be	sufficient
at	digital	sme	conference	thailand	sorasich	natenin	golf	founder	and	ceo	of	boonumpar	who	develop	his	business	by	using	data	to	capture	customers	insight	was	invited
he	came	up	with	ideas	that	led	to	the	success	and	various	expansion	of	his	business	such	as	boonumpar	hong	catering	bnp	cuisine	and	mr	chon
another	guest	speaker	is	nattapon	muangkham	nui	founder	and	owner	of	co	who	is	marketing	consultant	guest	lecturer	at	university	and	an	author	of	the	best	selling	book	titled	data	driven	marketing
both	of	them	came	to	share	their	experiences	from	using	data	in	the	business	to	sme	entrepreneurs	as	starting	idea	to	manage	their	own	data
data	collection	using	excel	program	some	of	the	entrepreneurs	might	have	no	idea	how	to	do	data	collection
golf	founder	and	ceo	of	boonumpar	shared	that	we	have	to	imagine	when	we	want	to	ask	lady	out	for	date
we	have	to	think	about	what	we	want	to	know	about	her
of	course	we	want	to	know	her	name	mobile	number	and	where	she	lives
all	that	mentioned	are	like	the	collection	of	customer	information	to	get	to	know	each	other	more
on	the	other	hand	nui	the	administrator	of	co	page	suggested	that	data	has	to	be	collected	from	the	total	sale	because	it	will	allow	us	to	know	the	daily	situation	of	the	business
we	will	know	the	days	with	good	sales	and	days	with	low	sales
then	we	can	proceed	on	the	list	of	what	sells	well	and	who	the	customers	are
the	majority	of	entrepreneurs	know	the	daily	total	sale	but	do	not	know	which	group	of	customers	contributed	to	the	sale
thus	the	important	thing	is	to	know	from	who	and	from	what	did	the	money	comes	as	well	as	when	the	money	came	from
next	group	the	customers
for	example	the	number	of	regular	and	casual	customers	the	sale	gained	from	each	group	and	what	products	made	the	highest	sale
all	these	can	be	gained	from	data
not	something	we	have	to	find	out	ourselves
in	case	it	is	an	offline	business	how	do	entrepreneurs	look	for	customer	information
nui	gave	an	example	of	the	food	stalls
if	they	have	pos	machine	customers	orders	can	be	recorded
however	if	they	are	small	food	stalls	it	is	suggested	that	they	list	orders	down	on	paper	and	type	the	list	in	the	line	application
at	the	end	of	the	day	they	have	to	gather	all	information	down	on	excel	once	more	and	this	is	the	way	to	easily	collect	data
how	to	use	data	to	bring	success	to	the	business	as	business	owner	who	makes	use	of	data	golf	said	that	when	his	business	was	still	small	he	filled	up	the	information	on	quotations	into	excel
but	when	his	business	has	expanded	erp	software	is	used	to	collect	data
for	example	boonruksa
this	business	collects	information	like	mobile	number	address	venue	number	of	monks	nearby	temples	number	of	monks	in	the	temple	etc
the	information	collected	is	very	detailed	and	when	they	are	doing	online	marketing	and	want	to	know	which	platform	the	sale	comes	from	the	method	used	would	be	number	platform
this	will	allow	him	to	know	the	platform	and	from	which	post	that	the	customers	come
then	hashtags	will	be	used	such	as	new	customer	not	yet	confirmed
so	that	special	offers	will	be	sent	directly	to	particular	customers	and	this	actually	helps	to	save	lot	of	marketing	cost
nowadays	linking	all	information	from	social	media	through	an	erp	system	is	easy	for	data	management
it	allows	classification	of	customers	to	be	easier	and	niche	marketing	to	be	possible
also	the	process	of	contacting	and	decision	making	of	customers	can	be	clearly	viewed	and	planning	can	be	done	entirely	as	well	as	overseeing	the	staff	performance	to	further	improve	the	team
data	collection	thus	leads	him	to	see	that	customers	order	food	to	give	alms	and	this	paves	the	way	to	the	new	business	idea	bnp	cuisine	that	comes	with	frozen	delivery	service
as	for	nui	who	is	consultant	for	many	smes	he	shared	case	studies	from	using	data	in	business
the	example	he	gave	was	floristry	business	with	branches
when	they	started	collecting	data	they	found	out	that	chidlom	branch	made	more	sales	on	flowers	that	are	commonly	used	for	merit	making	and	wreaths	while	thonglor	branchs	best	seller	were	lily	flower	bouquet	or	decorating	flowers
from	the	data	it	can	be	seen	that	different	branches	have	different	best	seller	products
if	we	superficially	take	the	information	we	would	think	that	chidlom	branch	should	have	more	variety	of	wreaths	on	sale	and	thonglor	branch	should	have	more	lily	flower	bouquet	and	decorating	flower
however	the	next	thing	that	we	should	do	is	to	find	out	why	these	products	become	best	sellers
if	we	observe	the	shop	in	chodlom	branch	we	will	see	that	majority	of	customers	are	female	upper	class	missus	who	buys	flowers	to	mainly	make	merit	at	the	temple
on	the	other	hand	customers	at	thonglor	branch	consist	mainly	of	foreigners	who	stay	in	the	nearby	condominium	and	purchase	flowers	to	decorate	their	room
according	to	the	observation	we	can	suggest	the	floristry	to	sell	more	related	products
for	example	the	chidlom	branch	can	sell	candles	and	incenses	along	with	flowers	and	thonglor	branch	can	display	room	decorating	products	on	their	shelves	and	sell	them	together	with	flowers
we	can	see	that	by	analyzing	the	sales	data	we	can	discover	the	target	groups	as	well	as	the	related	products	another	case	study	is	the	shoe	business	in	commerce
there	is	an	analysis	of	sales	and	it	shows	that	the	business	has	regular	customers	but	they	made	multiple	purchases	and	contribute	up	to	of	the	total	sale
when	this	information	is	obtained	if	the	business	has	limited	marketing	budget	they	can	be	more	specific	on	the	target	group	they	should	focus	on
when	they	dig	deeper	into	the	data	they	found	out	that	regular	customers	will	return	to	purchase	again	at	an	average	of	times	every	days
this	means	the	shop	does	not	have	to	send	promotions	to	customers	before	the	day	date	because	customers	are	likely	to	purchase	without	getting	any	discount
or	if	the	data	shows	that	there	are	times	more	female	customers	in	rayong	compared	to	other	cities	they	have	to	go	deeper	into	the	data	and	find	out	the	reason
ultimately	the	important	thing	is	to	know	how	to	make	promotion	that	is	related	to	the	products
if	we	gain	the	data	we	can	come	up	with	promotions	that	are	more	appealing	to	the	customers	and	sales	can	be	generated	faster
this	is	the	benefit	that	smes	will	get	by	using	data	from	commerce	or	marketplace	to	develop	their	business
identity	vs	anonymous	nui	felt	that	anonymous	data	will	at	least	allow	the	business	to	know	the	trend	overview	and	some	insights	such	as	best	selling	product	peak	period	and	target	group	and	this	overall	picture	can	be	brought	to	plan	marketing	strategy
however	if	the	data	is	identifiable	businesses	will	be	able	to	do	segmentation	and	know	more	about	customers	in	depth
at	the	same	time	golf	said	that	if	we	can	measure	and	collect	data	from	social	media	platforms	we	will	know	if	our	marketing	plan	is	done	on	suitable	channel
for	example	facebook	advertisement	will	flash	according	to	the	target	group	interest	and	age
we	have	to	check	if	these	are	our	real	targets
besides	he	felt	that	data	collection	will	help	to	reduce	cost	manage	and	organize	plan	help	us	come	up	with	sales	strategy	make	promotion	measure	efficiency	and	accurately	evaluate	staff
problems	with	thai	smes	and	data	usage	nui	shared	that	from	his	conversation	with	most	smes	he	found	out	that	they	have	no	idea	what	to	do	after	data	collection	because	they	did	not	set	clear	goal
another	hurdle	is	the	mindset	that	they	have	known	enough	because	they	have	experience	and	disregard	data	while	making	decisions
for	example	nui	had	an	endless	conversation	with	his	editor	on	the	thai	name	of	his	latest	book
so	they	flashed	advertisements	to	test	the	response	of	the	customers	to	see	which	thai	name	customers	would	want	to	buy	the	book	most
after	weeks	they	came	to	the	conclusion	without	having	to	argue
by	creating	assumptions	and	carry	out	the	experiment	we	will	reach	the	right	conclusion
at	the	same	time	golf	said	that	many	business	owners	did	not	use	data	to	their	advantage	despite	being	able	to	collect	lot	of	data	and	it	is	such	waste
cpvai	data	marketing	framework	to	allow	entrepreneurs	to	benefit	from	the	data	nui	gathered	all	his	experiences	on	data	marketing	and	shared	them	through	the	cpvai	model
he	advised	business	owners	to	set	clear	goal	on	what	they	want	to	know	before	collecting	data	according	to	the	mentioned	model
the	cpvai	model	consists	of	above	all	apart	from	data	collection	smes	should	not	overlook	customer	data	protection
therefore	this	information	must	be	protected	with	passcode	before	access	or	download	and	the	identity	of	customers	should	be	made	anonymous	by	using	numeral	codes	to	represent	the	customers
this	will	make	data	protection	secured	and	up	to	standard
besides	staff	involved	should	sign	contract	regarding	data	protection
this	will	be	another	way	to	secure	the	information	and	prevent	the	violation	of	using	information	inappropriately
more	importantly	when	data	is	collected	do	not	forget	to	use	it	to	our	advantage
only	then	that	entrepreneurs	will	see	the	beauty	of	using	data	in	their	business	and	it	will	help	them	to	decide	manage	boost	sales	and	create	income	tremendously	for	their	business	in	way	that	has	never	happened	before

if	the	organization	does	not	care	will	hurt	them
on	the	other	hand	if	it	comes	out	to	protect	and	make	everyone	feel	safe	it	is	considered	to	create	mental	value
makes	everyone	want	to	fully	repay	the	organization
well	motivated	staff	can	think	of	new	things	coming	out	endlessly
an	important	thing	must	not	forget	that	every	staff	life	is	part	of	the	organization	revenue	creator
should	not	be	abandoned
there	are	many	ways	to	treat	people
but	putting	money	directly	into	the	hand	not	as	sustainable	as	taking	the	job	that	creates	money	into	the	hands
because	giving	the	money	will	be	used	up	soon	but	the	work	will	help	everyone	to	earn	living	for	age
after	protecting	people	must	not	forget	to	protect	the	organization	as	well
which	ways	to	help	survive	in	times	of	crisis	need	to	reduce	unnecessary	expenses
by	choosing	to	cut	expenses	that	are	not	related	to	people	first	such	as	having	to	travel	to	meeting	then	change	to	an	online	meeting	instead
for	expenses	incurred	for	the	future	like	various	technologies	that	are	necessary	should	not	be	cut	off
should	also	seek	opportunities	in	times	of	crisis	by	knowing	in	time	for	the	crisis	situation	management
when	faced	with	problems	there	are	no	customers	coming	because	of	fear	of	germs	that	were	plagued	then	we	must	be	the	party	to	visit	the	customer	instead
the	organization	does	not	need	to	fire	anyone
but	should	find	way	for	everyone	to	work	to	make	money	during	this	crisis
providing	organizations	with	income	in	the	new	normal	style	which	may	help	reduce	unnecessary	expenses	as	well
tele	medicine	treatment	of	the	future	the	advent	of	technology	from	the	start	up	group	can	shake	the	business	community
even	health	groups	cannot	escape
heath	tech	is	also	changing	the	medical	industry
many	people	will	get	to	search	engines	like	google	to	find	information	about	the	symptoms	of	the	disease	and	drugs	used	for	treatment
if	suffering	from	minor	illness	the	drug	will	be	bought	and	taken	on	its	own
or	in	the	case	of	being	serious	illness	and	need	doctor
often	find	information	about	the	disease	that	should	be	treated	with	which	doctor	and	which	hospital	is	affiliated	with
and	then	go	to	the	hospital	to	treat	with	that	doctor
which	made	the	hospital	working	methods	different	from	the	past
many	hospitals	have	adopted	it
transformed	himself	into	an	excellent	center	to	treat	specialized	diseases	that	are	especially	difficult	to	treat
while	using	tele	care	or	tele	medicine	for	the	care	of	little	mild	disease
which	will	be	able	to	help	facilitate	both	patients	and	medical	personnel	with	remote	treatment
this	system	consists	of	main	parts	which	are	tele	consultant	come	in	the	form	of	virtual	hospital	available	hours	day
it	is	consultation	through	the	hospital	platform	that	connects	with	partners	such	as	banks	or	insurance	companies
which	helps	reduce	the	number	of	workers	and	unnecessary	expenses	tele	diagnosis	is	long	distance	diagnosis	through	small	innovation	called	tytocare
which	can	measure	body	temperature	check	the	skin	look	at	the	ears	look	at	the	mouth	to	see	if	the	symptoms	are	caused	by	virus	or	bacteria
including	listening	to	the	lungs	and	whether	the	heartbeat	is	normal	or	not
makes	patients	do	not	need	to	waste	time	traveling	to	the	hospital	with	little	illness
the	quick	work	allows	the	doctor	to	fully	spend	time	in	the	treatment	of	severe	diseases
tele	monitor	remote	care	system	for	chronic	home	disease	patients	via	engage	care	application
can	measure	blood	pressure	blood	sugar	and	blood	oxygen	level
for	patients	who	need	surgery	there	is	samitivej	pace
that	can	inform	the	treatment	status	tell	me	how	to	take	care	of	before	and	after	surgery
causing	both	patients	and	relatives	to	not	have	to	worry	about	what	their	status	is	now	if	in	doubt	you	can	ask	the	doctor	yourself
at	present	more	than	of	thai	people	use	the	baht	privilege	to	treat	all	diseases
which	is	mostly	minor	illness	the	budget	that	the	government	must	use	to	look	after	is	quite	high
while	new	diseases	occur	throughout	the	budget	is	therefore	not	enough
therefore	if	bringing	the	system	tele	medicine	widely	used	will	be	able	to	help	the	state	save	money
patients	do	not	need	to	travel	to	crowded	at	the	hospital
understand	patients	with	in	an	age	where	entrepreneurs	must	understand	customers	lot	to	create	brand	love	not	just	knowing	what	their	pain	points	are	but	must	respond	to	what	they	want
even	if	that	desire	changes	every	day
must	be	able	to	present	things	that	exceed	the	expectations	of	consumers	as	well
to	be	considered	successful
dr	chairat	panthuramporn	md	described	the	principle	of	as	follows	the	outcry	is	matter	of	the	past
what	kind	of	pain	point	does	the	patient	have	must	solve	successfully
if	you	can	do	it	then	you	can	continue
there	is	no	way	the	organization	can	create	innovation	if	the	old	problems	have	not	been	dealt	with
customers	are	not	happy	with	new	things	that	happen	if	there	are	still	old	issues	disturbing
want	is	the	current	need
it	is	about	situation	management
know	what	the	patient	needs
and	must	be	managed
because	that	needs	change	all	the	time	entrepreneurs	must	know	to	keep	up	with	consumers
wow	is	the	future
things	that	customers	didn	know	before	or	not	previously	thought
the	hospital	can	surpass	the	expectations	of	patients
which	not	only	does	sick	care	but	also	prevents	them	to	not	get	sick	early	care
being	able	to	make	people	not	ill	can	also	help	increase	gdp	and	reduce	the	heath	care	cost	for	the	country
the	future	of	all	doctors	will	not	be	the	duty	of	taking	care	of	sick	patients	but	is	like	health	coach
which	helps	everyone	to	know	about	taking	care	of	oneself	self	care
so	that	you	don	have	to	get	sick	and	go	to	the	hospital	so	the	doctor	can	look	after	the	treatment	focusing	on	specific	diseases	that	are	at	higher	risk
the	strengths	of	thai	medicine	in	the	eyes	of	the	world	in	the	covid	era	thai	medicine	is	recognized	in	the	eyes	of	the	world	in	terms	of	disease	control	patient	care	including	very	low	mortality	rate	when	compared	to	various	superpowers	countries	that	famous	for	their	medical
when	combining	the	basic	strengths	which	are	medical	fees	cheaper	than	foreign	countries	good	quality	treatment	and	services	combined	with	outstanding	strengths
highly	secure	and	the	ability	to	access	treatment	hours	day
especially	when	considering	the	common	strengths	of	thailand	which	are	widely	known	both	delicious	food	various	tourist	attractions	and	prominent	shopping	centers
all	of	this	can	make	thailand	the	center	of	wellness	changing	from	health	care	to	wealth	care	which	can	help	boost	the	country	gdp
in	the	future	when	doing	anything	it	cannot	be	single	person
next	normal	is	collaboration
when	bringing	the	best	people	in	each	field	to	work	together	will	be	able	to	create	new	things	that	always	meets	the	needs	of	consumers

few	years	ago	medical	tourism	or	medical	tourism	became	familiar	term	and	has	attracted	attention	as	new	tourism	market	segment	with	high	growth	potential
according	to	the	medical	tourism	association	mta	it	is	estimated	that	more	than	million	people	travel	abroad	for	medical	care	worldwide
the	global	medical	tourism	market	is	expanding	exponentially
the	main	reason	comes	from	the	cost	of	medical	care	in	developed	countries	that	are	very	expensive
compared	to	quality	medical	care	at	more	tangible	price	than	other	countries	including	access	to	time	consuming	treatments	evident	from	of	patients	want	better	treatment	while	want	to	pay	less
of	patients	looked	for	treatment	options	not	available	in	their	country	and	looked	for	the	fastest	possible	treatment	and	did	not	want	to	queue
in	addition	to	prices	and	advancements	in	treatment	technology	and	nursing	care	standards	other	factors	that	affect	the	choice	of	destination	country	include	convenience	and	cost	of	traveling	such	as	cheap	airfare	easy	visa	application	process	and	various	accommodation	options
why	thailand	meets	the	needs	of	the	medical	tourism	market
in	the	medical	tourism	index	mti	global	destination	conducted	by	the	international	healthcare	research	center	thailand	medical	tourism	industry	is	ranked	in	the	top	out	of	countries	based	on	destination	attractiveness	and	medical	tourism	cost	factors
scb	eic	research	center	analyzes	that	in	the	thai	medical	tourism	market	this	year	will	recover	to	higher	level	than	which	was	the	year	before	the	covid	crisis	which	is	expected	to	be	worth	more	than	billion	baht
driven	by	mega	trends	in	health	and	as	many	countries	around	the	world	are	entering	sliver	economy	the	middle	class	is	growing	and	purchasing	power	is	increasing	across	the	world
non	communicable	diseases	ncds	are	on	the	rise	worldwide	and	after	the	covid	crisis	people	are	becoming	more	and	more	health	conscious
in	the	view	of	scb	eic	thailand	has	strengths	that	attract	tourists	namely	reasonable	prices	at	competitive	level	wide	range	of	expertise
the	most	internationally	standardized	medical	facility	in	asean	and	there	are	many	popular	tourist	attractions	while	medtourpress	middle	eastern	media	that	presents	medical	tourism
one	of	the	reasons	why	thailand	is	at	the	forefront	of	the	medical	tourism	market	is	its	ability	to	treat	specific	diseases
such	as	organ	transplant	infertility	treatment	etc
however	because	the	current	competition	in	this	market	is	very	high
in	which	thailand	must	face	competition	from	countries	such	as	turkey	qatar	united	arab	emirates	malaysia	singapore	who	are	accelerating	the	development	of	leading	medical	centers	to	penetrate	the	medical	tourism	market	including	the	risk	of	brain	drain	brain	drain	and	disruption	from	health	tech	technology
scb	eic	has	therefore	suggested	strategies	that	will	help	push	thailand	to	upgrade	to	become	leader	in	the	medical	tourism	market	namely	branding	of	medical	tourism	in	the	global	market	by	developing	expertise	in	specific	treatments	and	using	soft	power	to	encourage	foreigners	to	be	interested	build	alliances	with	various	business	sectors	such	as	airlines	hotels	spas	rehabilitation	centers	tour	operators	insurance	companies	especially	offering	comprehensive	packages	including	medical	tourism
extending	to	health	tourism	wellness	tourism	promoting	tourism	in	the	country	it	helps	to	facilitate	and	can	organize	promotions	to	reach	more	tourists
upgrading	service	quality	and	advancement	in	treatment	to	promote	thailand	to	be	leading	medical	center	and	be	able	to	compete	with	world	class	competitors
by	creating	network	of	cooperation	between	the	private	sector	the	academia	and	the	public	sector	as	well	as	public	government	cooperation	as	well	elevate	thailand	to	be	leading	medical	center	by	using	healthtech	to	increase	efficiency	and	convenience	in	providing	services	to	add	more	selling	points	for	businesses	based	on	the	information	above	summary	of	reasons	that	lead	thailand	to	become	leader	in	the	medical	tourism	market	are	price	medical	expenses	in	thailand	hospitals	are	lower	than	those	in	the	united	states	canada	europe
treatment	quality	thai	doctors	are	knowledgeable	and	well	trained
many	doctors	are	qualified	from	medical	schools	in	the	uk	and	provide	professional	care	to	their	patients
hospitals	that	have	received	service	quality	standards	the	service	quality	of	many	hospitals	in	thailand	has	been	recognized	as	world	class
many	of	them	are	jci	accreditation	certified
private	hospital	operators	are	ramping	up	their	service	capabilities	to	attract	medical	tourists	around	the	world
although	at	present	thai	private	hospitals	have	the	potential	and	readiness	to	support	medical	tourists	that	are	quite	good	many	hospitals	are	accelerating	to	develop	and	upgrade	their	services	in	various	forms	to	seize	this	opportunity	such	as	developing	the	hospital	into	specialized	medical	center	expanding	cooperation	with	business	partners	building	comprehensive	medical	and	health	center	and	the	application	of	digital	technology
convenience	in	issuing	visas	according	to	the	policy	to	support	and	push	thailand	into	an	international	health	center	medical	hub	by	the	government	has	reduced	visa	fees	for	medical	treatment	for	period	of	year	which	foreign	patients	can	travel	to
thailand	many	times	and	not	more	than	days	each	time	popular	tourist	attractions	thailand	has	always	been	famous	for	tourism
there	are	also	different	marketing	strategies	aimed	at	advertising	basic	medical	services	such	as	health	check	ups
outpatient	treatment	is	inexpensive	for	general	tourists	who	originally	intended	to	travel	only	to	receive	treatment	and	turn	them	into	medical	tourism	market	customers
continuous	marketing	strategies	the	medical	tourism	industry	in	thailand	dates	to	the	when	many	countries	in	southeast	asia	used	it	as	tool	to	generate	money	into	the	country
thailand	began	to	actively	promote	medical	tourism	in	using	marketing	strategy	that	focuses	on	tangible	prices	complete	service	highlighting	various	aspects	of	treatment	since	cancer	treatment	beauty	and	plastic	surgery
there	is	list	of	hospitals	that	specialize	in	specific	areas	helping	people	who	are	interested	in	finding	information	and	making	decisions	easily
importantly	both	the	public	and	private	sectors	see	opportunities	and	develop	plans	to	penetrate	the	medical	tourism	market
the	government	has	policy	to	support	and	push	thailand	to	become	an	international	health	hub	medical	hub	by	from	investment	promotion	through	the	boi
in	the	government	announced	the	establishment	of	the	andaman	health	economic	corridor	awc	covering	southern	provinces	to	develop	expertise	in	treating	specific	diseases
it	has	started	to	approve	the	andaman	international	health	center	project	in	phuket	and	to	drive	towards	achieving	that	goal	recently	thailand	has	proposed	to	host	specialized	expo	in	under	the	name	expo	phuket	thailand	with	the	concept	of	life	of	the	future	sharing	prosperity

previously	with	china	ccfta	and	from	now	on	the	goal	is	to	do	ftas	with	more	main	trading	partners	including	the	united	arab	emirates	india	japan	the	eurasian	economic	union	eaeu	canada	and	latin	america
in	addition	to	the	regional	comprehensive	economic	partnership	rcep	which	consists	of	asean	countries	china	south	korea	japan	australia	and	new	zealand
this	is	to	expand	export	markets	and	attract	investors	from	other	countries	to	invest	in	setting	up	more	production	bases	in	cambodia
by	focusing	on	the	export	of	important	economic	products	of	the	country	such	as	clothes	shoes	bags	and	travel	equipment
including	agricultural	products
it	expands	the	economic	potential	of	cambodia
products	produced	in	cambodia	can	reach	wider	market
it	is	an	attempt	to	adapt	in	addition	to	relying	mainly	on	the	european	union	eu	as	in	the	past
for	the	latest	bilateral	free	trade	agreement	with	south	korea	exemption	from	customs	duties	on	exports	of	clothing	footwear	luggage	beverages	rubber	medicine	and	agricultural	products	and	electronic	components	to	south	korea
south	korea	is	exempt	from	tariffs	on	exports	of	vehicles	and	electrical	appliances	kitchen	equipment	and	plastic	products	also	to	cambodia
as	for	agricultural	products	from	cambodia	they	are	increasingly	being	accepted	by	south	korea
especially	the	turmeric	mango	which	is	considered	the	top	agricultural	product	exported	to	south	korea
it	has	negotiated	with	south	korea	hyundai	to	develop	pesticides
for	more	quality	products	and	other	agricultural	products	that	south	korea	is	interested	in	importing	from	cambodia	as	well
this	is	an	opportunity	for	thailand	to	expand	its	business	and	bring	knowledge	and	expertise	in	producing	products	into	cambodia	whether	it	joint	venture	being	full	service	business	consulting	company	or	to	set	up	production	base	in	cambodia

in	addition	thailand	is	already	member	of	the	rcep
with	cambodia	entering	into	bilateral	free	trade	agreement	with	south	korea	ckfta	thailand	will	benefit	from	increasing	the	opportunity	to	accumulate	origins	in	the	production	network	of	all	rcep	member	countries	which	use	same	origin	criteria
this	makes	it	more	consistent	and	flexible	and	can	also	collect	more	raw	materials	for	production	from	many	sources
thai	entrepreneurs	should	prepare	to	take	advantage	of	the	rcep	agreement	to	expand	exports	to	the	south	korean	market	more	including	examining	the	benefits	under	various	fta	frameworks	and	choosing	to	use	them	to	suit	the	nature	of	the	business

google	facebook	apple	ebay	adobe	yahoo	netflix	oracle	and	other	leading	companies	still	remember	the	old	day	on	the	slow	car	running	across	the	valley	of	the	number	one	technology	and	innovations
could	not	help	but	feel	speculate	seeing	technological	company	headquarters	which	am	big	fan	of
this	place	cant	be	anywhere	but	silicon	valley	the	valley	of	technologies	located	in	the	south	of	san	francisco	bay	california
today	we	will	get	to	know	the	starting	point	of	silicon	valley	and	what	makes	this	modern	valley	center	of	startup	and	world	class	tech	firms
the	greatness	of	silicon	valley	this	center	of	high	technology	is	home	of	many	giant	tech	firms	specialized	in	computers	social	media	internet	software	hardware	fiber	optic	and	medical	equipment
more	than	of	fortune	tech	companies	with	the	highest	revenue	are	located	here	for	example	google	world	leading	search	engine	and	facebook	giant	social	media
silicon	valley	is	also	center	of	thousands	of	startup	companies	and	one	third	of	venture	capital	or	companies	investing	in	startups
hence	silicon	valley	is	an	expensive	land	as	it	is	hub	and	perfect	ecosystem	of	it	startup	and	science
it	is	the	center	of	high	quality	it	labor
therefore	silicon	valley	has	the	highest	density	of	both	it	companies	and	employees	in	the	united	states
silicon	valley	becomes	symbol	of	american	high	technology	which	holds	enormous	economic	value	and	also	represents	the	company	leader	for	researching	and	developing	it	innovation
moreover	silicon	valley	is	important	to	the	us	economy	in	the	employment	and	income	perspective	followed	by	taxing	and	stock	value	in	the	market
origin	of	the	name	silicon	valley	many	people	might	misunderstand	that	silicon	valley	is	the	city	name	however	silicon	valley	covers	several	cities	which	the	biggest	is	san	jose
other	cities	are	santa	clara	sunnyvale	mountain	view	menlo	park	and	palo	alto
san	jose	also	has	the	third	highest	gdp	per	capita	in	the	world	following	zurich	and	oslo
don	hoefler	is	the	one	who	called	this	valley	silicon	valley	in	the	article	silicon	valley	usa	in	the	name	was	given	during	the	early	period	of	semiconductor	computer	chips	production	which	has	silicon	as	the	major	component
later	during	early	such	name	was	generally	used	after	the	origin	of	ibm	including	hardware	and	software	production
why	silicon	valley	is	successful	there	are	many	reasons	make	silicon	valley	so	successful	which	are	apart	from	stanford	there	are	other	leading	universities	which	are	the	university	of	california	at	berkeley	san	jose	state	university	also	plays	an	important	role	in	researching	innovating	and	developing	manpower	to	serve	the	technological	market
well	known	companies	which	have	their	headquarters	located	in	silicon	valley	it	can	be	seen	that	the	success	of	silicon	valley	is	not	possible	without	support	from	quality	institutions	with	the	aim	of	social	development	by	developing	business	and	innovation	such	as	stanford
hopefully	one	day	our	leading	universities	in	thailand	will	reach	such	point	and	start	driving	technology	development	and	increasing	the	ability	to	compete	for	our	nation
anyone	interested	to	visit	silicon	valley	can	fly	to	san	francisco	plus	half	an	hour	drive
apart	from	leading	companies	there	are	lot	of	good	museums	including	the	computer	history	museum	childrens	discovery	museum	of	san	jose	the	intel	museum	moffett	field	historical	society	museum

innovation	thinking	outside	the	box	and	the	neat	issue	must	be	given	to	japan
even	the	laundry	business	if	it	is	in	our	home	looks	like	normal	business
but	that	not	in	japan
laundry	businesses	or	dry	cleaning	businesses	are	very	popular	among	japanese	people
from	small	shop	to	the	store	that	is	large	national	chain
if	walking	near	the	area	train	stations	in	tokyo	will	find	laundry	or	dry	cleaning	shops	in	just	minutes	on	foot
many	laundry	shops	that	are	open	indicate	the	popularity	of	japanese	people	in	using	this	type	of	service
aside	from	the	many	shops	the	price	is	not	expensive
for	japanese	people	because	the	laundry	of	one	working	shirt	falls	at	just	yen	each	or	about	baht	per	person	because	he	does	not	just	wash	it	on	regular	basis	but	exquisite	in	every	step
of	laundry	shops	did	not	wash	by	themselves	at	the	store	but	sent	to	industrial	laundry	plant	or	laundry	factory
which	the	factory	will	pick	up	some	clothes	from	the	nearby	laundry	shop
each	shop	before	sending	the	clothes	to	the	factory	will	put	water	resistant	paper	labels	on	each	item	of	clothing
the	numbers	or	codes	will	tell	which	store	the	fabric	comes	from	and	which	customer	belongs	to
and	says	that	there	are	stained	spots	that	need	special	care	where	including	the	washing	methods	that	customers	want
therefore	there	is	no	problem	with	sending	the	wrong	clothes	to	the	shop	or	the	wrong	customer
the	washing	plant	will	use	the	most	modern	technology	to	meet	the	needs	of	each	customer
there	will	be	computer	system	to	manage	the	lists	of	each	customer
just	scan	the	card	information	about	that	piece	of	clothing	will	be	displayed
for	example	some	customers	want	to	fold	the	shirt	without	hanging
or	where	the	fabric	has	lot	of	stains
the	specific	needs	of	each	client	are	all	recorded
how	detailed
when	the	clothes	arrive	at	the	factory	the	staff	will	look	at	the	condition	of	the	fabric	how	they	look	what	kind	of	method	should	be	used
if	there	is	stain	the	stain	will	be	removed	first	using	special	method
such	as	using	an	ultrasound	system	with	various	types	of	cleaners	that	are	suitable	for	the	stain
some	stores	call	it	specialist	in	removing	stains
the	more	expensive	name	brand	clothing	requires	expertise
for	example	there	are	up	to	different	stain	removers	which	require	knowledge
expertise	because	using	too	strong	pill	can	damage	the	fabric
after	that	it	will	be	washed	with	washing	machine	suitable	for	each	type	of	fabric
after	that	go	to	the	ironing	machine	such	as	the	shirt	collar	and	forearm	first
then	go	into	the	torso	machine	and	arm	blower	which	the	ironing	machine	can	iron	up	to	peers	per	hour
aside	from	laundry	shops	or	dry	cleaners	coin	operated	laundry	shop	also	known	as	modern	coin	laundries	it	becoming	very	popular	in	japan
many	shops	are	decorated	in	hip	style	such	as	decorating	with	bare	cement
some	shops	are	both	coin	operated	laundry	shops	and	public	bathhouses
while	waiting	for	the	clothes	to	finish	washing	the	owner	of	the	cloth	can	go	to	relax	in	the	water
once	the	shower	is	finished	the	fabric	is	finished
some	shops	combine	coin	laundry	and	caf
the	exterior	is	like	chic	cafe	with	high	quality	beverages	and	bakeries
the	shopkeeper	described	the	idea	that	because	one	laundry	took	an	hour
therefore	they	want	people	to	be	happy	while	waiting	for	the	clothes	to	finish	therefore	combining	the	cafes	with	coin	operated	laundry	shops
in	addition	there	are	also	many	washing	machines	and	dryers	to	choose	from
both	separately	wash	fry	or	wash	and	dry	in	one	machine
including	an	extra	large	washing	machine	with	capacity	of	kilos	for	washing	large	items	such	as	blankets
but	what	is	even	more	interesting	is	the	sneakers	washing	machine	and	drying	machine	in	just	minutes
not	enough	there	is	also	an	application	to	be	able	to	check	whether	any	washing	machines	are	currently	available	or	not	so	as	not	to	waste	time	traveling	and	must	wait	long	time
but	if	anyone	doesn	want	to	wait	or	doesn	have	time	then	there	can	hire	staff	to	do	laundry	instead	just	leave	the	clothes	someone	will	go	to	the	washing	machine	and	fold	the	clothes	neatly
come	back	and	get	nice	fragrance
aside	from	creativity	and	technology	the	kindness	of	japanese	people	is	also	reflected	in	the	laundry
when	the	march	earthquake	and	tsunami	caused	many	people	to	lose	their	homes	they	were	not	able	to	wash	their	clothes
laundry	shops	that	are	still	open	therefore	help	by	providing	laundry	services	for	free	to	victims
because	even	without	house	japanese	people	still	want	to	wear	clean	clothes
one	owner	of	the	washing	plant	said	that	he	was	happy	to	make	the	affected	people	happier
and	learned	that	even	during	the	crisis	the	laundry	business	is	still	important	to	society
and	confident	that	about	laundry	innovations	japan	is	first	and	foremost
right	now	the	washing	machine	business	coin	operated	clothes	dryers	in	our	country	are	becoming	popular	with	small	stores	large	stores	gradually	rising
even	some	detergent	brands	have	started	this	business	too
in	addition	new	generation	customers	are	also	interested	in	using	the	service
anyone	interested	in	doing	this	business	or	already	have	shop	but	want	to	develop	it	to	be	more	modern	but	still	lacking	funds
scb	has	solution	for	loans	to	small	businesses

the	true	story	that	international	business	people	face	in	the	war	for	import	export	business	if	missing	the	correct	information	is	like	going	out	to	fight	without	weapons	accurate	information	timely	easy	to	understand	helping	to	make	more	accurate	decisions	and	gain	an	advantage	in	this	business	war
today	we	have	businessmen	in	the	chemical	industry
khun	kaj	kositrat	from	chemmin	corporation	and	khun	nattapong	sintavarayan	from	world	food	chemical	will	share	the	importance	of	information	as	weapon	to	gain	an	advantage	over	competitors	in	the	business	world	that	competes	with	information	information	secret	weapon	to	victory	chemicals	are	not	short	supply	chains	but	each	long	supply	chain	can	be	used	in	many	industries
therefore	if	anything	changes	even	little	will	cause	the	market	price	to	change	very	fast
the	difficulty	is	understanding	and	accessing	this	information
if	we	can	update	the	situation	on	both	the	supply	and	demand	side	how	quickly	we	will	manage	the	business	safely
and	make	the	business	more	stable
if	knowing	this	information	first	we	will	be	able	to	manage	the	stock
make	the	price	better	than	others	faster	than	others	khun	kaj	kositrat	from	chemmin	corporation	importer	of	chemical	raw	materials	tells	the	importance	of	having	fast	and	accurate	information
this	era	is	the	age	of	information
businesses	must	compete	with	information
anyone	who	has	faster	and	more	timely	information	will	be	able	to	leave	their	competitors	farther	and	faster
in	this	era	we	must	develop	methods	of	data	analysis
with	clear	information	standards	within	the	organization	and	bringing	information	from	outside	the	organization	into	therefore	the	format	of	the	data	entered	the	more	central	the	more	the	easier	to	manage
scb	trade	club	has	the	potential
it	is	good	opportunity	to	have	system	that	helps	centralize	data	so	we	can	manage	external	data	more	easily
khun	kaj	added	that	the	importance	of	having	complete	international	data	center	in	one	place	the	opportunity	lost	to	the	confusion	in	the	preparation	of	documents	and	procedures	endlessly	regardless	of	what	you	import	what	will	you	produce	you	must	register	correctly
we	will	bring	product	to	be	registered
regarding	the	request	for	permission	everything	in	this	process	if	we	go	the	wrong	way	it	will	take	very	long	time
it	will	make	us	lose	trade	opportunities
khun	nattapong	sintavarayan	from	world	food	chemical	business	of	importing	products	from	foreign	countries	like	food	chemistry	feed	chemistry	industrial	chemistry	said
that	is	one	of	the	pain	points	that	import	and	export	business	entrepreneurs	encounter
lot	of	information	to	study	complex	procedures	must	be	passed	correctly
because	the	slower	and	more	wrong	it	is	the	greater	the	business	opportunity	that	is	lost
it	problem	for	people	who	don	yet	have	license
but	if	you	have	license	then	it	will	become	plus	you	have	certificate	you	can
others	can
khun	nat	described	the	opportunity	of	people	who	registered	products	faster
but	it	is	not	easy	to	go	through	each	stage	and	each	step
some	products	take	more	than	half	year	to	successfully	register
which	means	the	business	advantage	that	must	be	lost	to	competitors	complicated	both	import	and	export	not	just	an	import	business	that	has	to	go	through	complicated	government	process	and	documents
the	same	applies	to	exports
it	has	been	difficult	since	we	were	already	in	the	country
we	can	send	anything	out	through	the	customs	or	port	authorities
he	will	have	to	ask	for	the	document	that	how	risky	is	this	product
is	it	forbidden	product
is	it	rare	item
this	is	the	first	line
namely	from	thailand	out	of	the	country
the	second	checkpoint	is	when	the	products	have	arrived	what	is	the	destination	he	wants
which	each	place	and	each	product	is	not	the	same	not	all	countries	are	the	same	said	nat	telling	the	challenges	of	import	export	businesses
these	problems	will	be	greatly	reduced	when	there	is	trade	portal
the	key	features	in	scb	trade	club	are	the	knowledge	base	for	doing	international	business	such	as	customs	duties	and	local	taxes	sanctions	lists	best	countries	for	trade	trade

the	true	story	that	international	businesspeople	face	in	the	past	exports	of	products	to	foreign	countries	stepping	out	into	the	world	market	can	be	difficult
but	in	today	world	when	there	is	technology	that	shortens	the	world
khun	kornvika	cio	deestone	corporation	will	talk	to	us	about	the	use	of	technology	that	makes	difficult	matters	become	easier
distance	is	not	an	obstacle	causing	foreigners	languages	cultures	and	rules	to	do	business	mutual	understanding	can	make	trading	easier	and	this	is	an	opportunity	for	thai	exporters	to	easily	step	up	to	enter	the	new	market
how	difficult	is	the	thai	tire	export	market
khun	kornvika	cio	deestone	corporation	the	large	tire	manufacturer	in	thailand	thai	company	says	that	in	general	thai	tire	exports
fundamentally	not	difficult	because	in	the	international	market	already	accept	products	processed	from	thai	rubber
because	of	the	natural	rubber	of	thailand	we	have	good	quality
but	in	the	past	it	must	be	acknowledged	that	exports	are	much	more	difficult	than	the	present	because	there	is	no	technology	to	help
going	out	to	sell	is	carrying	goods	into	various	fairs	that	they	organize
we	will	have	problem	that	once	we	have	found	partner	how	can	we	know	that	this	partner	is	the	right	partner
khun	korn	said	that	unlike	the	present	day	there	are	online	platforms	that	collect	both	various	information	about	the	import	and	export	of	each	country
as	well	as	information	from	business	partners	around	the	world	to	help	exporters	do	business	more	easily
trade	fair	how	to	find	traditional	partners	with	restrictions	khun	korn	view	that	going	to	trade	fairs	is	costly
going	once	sometimes	has	high	cost
while	not	getting	anything	back	especially	when	looking	for	the	right	partner
it	quite	difficult	to	know	that	in	that	country	people	the	one	who	entered	our	booth	is	he	trusted	person
there	are	lot	of	steps	after	that	that	need	to	be	checked
and	many	times	it	can	be	checked
khun	korn	talks	about	the	limitations	of	finding	reliable	partner	from	the	trade	fair
however	she	still	views	the	trade	fair	still	needed	but	entrepreneurs	should	find	additional	tools	that	will	help	extend	the	fair	to	be	more	efficient	than	before
in	which	the	tool	is	to	find	out	who	this	partner	is	where	they	come	from	can	you	trust	it
currently	it	can	be	checked	from	many	sources	such	as	trade	insurance	which	will	be	able	to	tell	what	the	financial	partner	is	but	with	the	trade	insurance	costs	will	be	added
but	today	the	scb	launches	the	scb	trade	club	program	which	can	be	another	step	to	check	if	this	customer	actually	exists
how	long	has	it	been	established	and	how	much	has	been	sold
these	data	can	be	used	as	information	for	consideration
khun	korn	talks	about	new	tool	such	as	the	scb	trade	club	which	can	extend	the	trade	fair	more	efficiently
large	market	with	potential	but	not	yet	accessible	what	is	the	cause
khun	korn	described	the	potential	market	and	large	markets	such	as	russia	and	south	american	countries
thai	entrepreneurs	are	still	not	doing	well	in	the	market
she	said	that	both	groups	have	characters	that	are	quite	similar
there	is	lot	of	protection	for	domestic	manufacturers
and	checking	what	the	customer	is	like	who	it	comes	from	is	quite	difficult
in	addition	the	trading	system	uses	different	methods
these	reasons	make	it	difficult	to	decide	whether	it	is	safe	to	trade	in	those	markets	or	not
are	you	good	at	defending	yourself
which	she	sees	as	very	difficult	matter
but	if	there	are	additional	tools	to	help	with	the	information	of	trade	partners	in	that	country	to	know	that	each	of	their	partners	has	real	network	reliable	having	good	financial	credit	and	being	on	the	scb	trade	club	list	will	be	able	to	ensure	that	this	partner	actually	exists	and	has	true	business	management	capabilities
how	does	the	trade	club	and	trade	portal	help	exporters
basically	the	data	that	the	scb	trade	club	has	collected	in	the	trade	portal	whether	it	is	the	export	data	in	each	country
export	statistics	whether	rubber	products	or	related	products	it	is	quite	useful	because	there	are	many	insights	that	can	help	us	to	know	how	much	the	current	export	we	are	comparing	to	the	whole	country
there	are	still	markets	that	have	chance	to	enter	again
and	the	very	interesting	part	which	is	in	the	supplier	list	and	importer	list
this	is	not	just	the	customer	information	only	even	the	materials	we	use	import	export	we	can	check	that	nowadays	there	is	change	in	the	list	of	suppliers
who	is	new
who	has	grown	up
and	clarification	of	import	duty	import	export	costs	rules	involved	in	the	cost
this	is	very	impressive	that	scb	trade	club	has	collected	quite	lot	of	information	and	resolution
is	accurate	as	guideline
khun	korn	shared	his	impressions	of	the	scb	trade	club	and	trade	portal	features	and	functions
the	phrase	knowledge	is	like	having	hundreds	of	thousands	of	assets	still	works	well	in	today	world
especially	the	world	of	export	and	import	enterprises	that	need	to	update	information	about	various	regulations	of	each	country	that	is	constantly	changing	including	various	numeric	data	that	will	be	used	to	make	decisions	in	marketing
and	another	very	important	part	is	the	information	that	the	partners	will	decide	to	join	hands	as	partners	to	do	business	together	with	how	reliable	because	nobody	would	want	to	be	hurt	by	choosing	the	wrong	partner

there	is	higher	use	of	online	channels
therefore	operators	must	adjust
accelerate	the	creation	of	the	identity	in	accordance	with	the	new	battlegrounds	that	consumers	lifestyles	change	in	timely	manner
fortunately	today	there	is	technology	to	help	entrepreneurs
which	though	the	business	is	not	widely	known	or	have	many	investments	can	easily	reach	the	target	audience	through	consumer	search	behavior	on	powerful	channels	such	as	google	search	and	google	maps

because	if	customers	pay	via	qr	code	scanning	the	destination	account	will	show	as	the	store	name

avoid	inviting	your	business	partner	to	lunch	many	cambodian	people	take	power	nap	after	lunch	to	refresh	themselves	for	working	in	the	afternoon	so	you	should	avoid	inviting	them	to	lunch

hotel	operations	have	been	one	of	the	main	businesses	of	the	tourism	industry	which	has	brought	about	thailand	revenue	and	reputation	for	long	time
especially	in	the	age	that	digital	plays	role	in	every	dimension	of	life
the	marketing	of	the	hotel	business	today	must	develop	into	full	digital	marketing
khun	ukit	tungseubkul	founder	and	ceo	of	mintedimages	co	ltd	one	of	the	mentors	and	instructor	course	the	dots	hotel	game	changer	by	scb	sme	has	provided	digital	marketing	knowledge	specifically	for	hotel	operators	to	meet	the	needs	of	the	customers	and	the	digital	age	why	digital	marketing
technology	brings	change	in	which	the	most	changing	technology	is	consumer	behavior	but	it	is	the	consumer	who	approached	the	digital	media
which	khun	ukrit	points	out	that	the	media	in	the	analog	era	does	not	reach	today	consumers
that	is	the	answer	to	why	digital	marketing	and	from	before	that	consumer	behavior	is	direct
consuming	lot	of	product	advertisements	through	the	media	then	resulting	in	purchase	but	today	consumers	are	less	loyal	to	the	brand	including	the	promotion	information	search	price	comparison	etc	it	is	necessary	to	have	an	effective	online	marketing	strategy
think	of	online	think	of	mobile	according	to	google	statistics	current	people	watch	mobile	phones	times	day
thai	use	mobile	phones	to	watch	facebook	for	about	half	hour	day	and	of	purchases	made	on	mobile	devices
this	information	is	the	source	of	digital	marketing	rules
the	important	thing	is	think	of	online	think	of	mobile	every	communication	that	goes	out	must	be	suitable	for	viewing	on	mobile	phones
whether	the	image	was	posted	on	facebook	ig	line	the	text	size	must	be	suitable	for	reading	on	mobile	phones	and	interesting	enough	to	not	be	plowed	through
however	there	is	still	of	the	importance	of	online	media
because	it	not	just	about	social	media
khun	ukrit	emphasized	that	in	online	marketing	website	is	the	most	important	part
because	aside	from	being	the	only	asset	that	entrepreneurs	can	hold	online	the	website	is	also	silent	sales	storefront	that	is	open	for	sale	hours	day	days
it	is	an	important	factor	for	customers	to	decide	before	coming	to	the	hotel
which	if	compared	with	good	salespeople	good	website	must	be	able	to	bring	out	the	most	points	of	sale	service	and	user	friendly
and	use	all	digital	media	to	pull	customers	into	the	website	because	for	the	hotel	business	it	is	considered	an	commerce	business	model	in	which	online	shopping	until	payment	occurs
customers	have	never	seen	sales	page
unlike	other	businesses	such	as	real	estate	etc
that	use	online	as	tool	to	pull	customers	to	buy	with	sales
website	is	more	important	than	sales	as	already	mentioned	websites	are	at	the	heart	of	online	marketing
every	digital	media	is	used	to	drive	customers	to	the	website
which	for	the	hotel	business	digital	media	tools	used	are	divided	into	online	media	rich	banner	google	search	seo	sme	social	media	facebook	youtube	line	ig	blogs	including	the	creation	of	word	of	mouth	via	friend	get	friend	forward	mail	forum	webboard	in	addition	to	being	silent	sales	the	special	feature	of	the	website	is	the	ability	to	keep	detailed	visitor	statistics
like	how	many	people	watched	it	how	long	they	watched	it	which	page	they	watched	how	long	click	on	which	button
where	do	you	leave	the	website
the	statistics	here	when	combined	with	social	media	statistics	can	be	used	to	analyze	the	buying	behavior	of	customers	based	on	the	sales	funnel	principles
allowing	operators	to	know	problems	and	improve	communication	strategies	and	increase	sales
for	example	using	social	media	to	create	travel	inspiration	awareness	to	reach	the	market
people	click	on	the	website
research	consideration	clicks	booking	conversion	experience	loyalty	post	stay	online	marketing	tips	in	steps	strategy	for	finding	real	customers	online	in	digital	marketing	facebook	is	the	most	effective	platform	to	reach	your	target	audience	because	facebook	has	all	the	information	that	people	do	on	mobile	phones
regardless	of	the	page	that	clicks	like	the	content	that	is	read	relationships	with	various	people	around	them	etc	which	indicate	their	preferences	and	tastes
and	facebook	also	predictions	of	people	behavior	predictive	behavior	very	precisely
many	people	think	that	creating	facebook	page	must	have	lot	of	like	but	the	fact	that	like	does	not	mean	sales
and	sometimes	the	top	people	who	like	it	are	not	real	customers
however	facebook	users	are	divided	into	groups
first	group	that	likes	to	click	engager	click	without	thinking	anything	and	watchers	namely	watching	but	not	clicking
the	statistics	say	that	most	of	these	people	have	the	status	and	power	to	really	buy
importantly	statistics	say	that	of	people	who	view	ads	and	buy	products	won	click
therefore	social	behavior	is	not	potential	buyer
online	advertising	communication	must	find	real	customers	using	various	devices
of	powerful	platforms	like	facebook	and	google
khun	ukrit	emphasized	that	it	is	advertising	not	viral
because	advertising	is	something	that	entrepreneurs	can	control	and	target	to	find	real	customers
while	viral	has	no	control	and	may	sweep	away	the	non	customer	groups	to	tumultuous	pages
target	customers	using	facebook	and	google	entrepreneurs	can	use	facebook	to	target	the	core	audience	by	selecting	demographics	interests	behaviors	location	and	connection	and	target	custom	target	groups
also	known	as	custom	audience	is	to	shoot	advertisements	directly	to	our	designated	customers	using	the	old	email	telephone	database
people	who	are	interested	in	our	hotel
which	can	be	seen	from	people	viewing	the	website	engage	with	applications	facebook	ig	pages	etc
but	things	to	keep	in	mind	are	if	the	customer	has	many	groups	it	must	be	adjusted	to	the	media	that	is	suitable	for	each	target	group	as	well
if	you	are	not	sure	which	workpiece	will	work	you	can	do	testing
run	workpieces	at	time	and	see	the	feedback
as	for	the	video	clip	it	has	more	influence	on	people	lives
therefore	missing	advertisements	must	think	about	video
and	the	video	clip	design	must	be	vertical	to	be	mobile
for	the	clip	on	facebook	people	will	watch	only	seconds	when	plowing
while	the	clip	on	youtube	people	watching	longer	than	the	clip	used	on	facebook	must	give	the	selling	point	and	the	hotel	brand	come	out	from	the	beginning	of	the	clip
however	if	outside	of	facebook	google	is	digital	marketing	platform	that	has	the	most	comprehensive	tools	from	google	search	google	map	google	ad	youtube	gmail	and	display	network
khun	ukrit	summarized	the	principle	of	using	google	tools	that	the	hotel	business	has	google	search	as	the	starting	point
if	people	remember	the	name	of	the	hotel	they	will	search	for
which	we	must	pin	google	my	business	to	our	hotel	to	appear	on	the	map	otherwise	people	will	see	other	nearby	hotels
in	the	case	that	people	are	not	specific	the	hotel	will	search	by	entering	the	name	of	tourist	city	such	as	family	hotels	in	pattaya	which	operators	must	market	seo	and	sem	with	various	keywords	let	our	hotel	name	appear	when	customers	search	for
in	addition	display	network	is	tool	for	the	banner	to	appear	on	various	websites
that	can	match	the	target	group	without	having	to	use	high	costs
and	what	google	is	powerful	online	marketing	tool	is	the	ability	to	effectively	retarget	customers
if	customer	clicks	on	the	website	and	has	not	yet	decided	to	reserve	google	will	be	retargeting	by	serving	ads	to	track	that	customer	in	all	platforms	to	encourage	buying
but	retargeting	is	only	possible	if	people	enter	the	website
in	this	regard	khun	ukrit	emphasized	once	again	that	the	secret	of	successful	website	is	beautiful	appearance	nice	to	see	ui	user	interface	easy	to	use	ux	user	experience	having	good	backyard	programming	system	fast	loading	easy	to	update	so	it	important	that	designers	and	programmers	have	to	be	the	same	team
must	support	marketing	strategies	for	conversion
finally	the	important	thing	is	the	measurement	the	advantage	of	digital	marketing	is	that	it	can	be	changed	all	the	time
but	knowing	how	to	adjust	it	must	be	evaluated	in	order	to	take	the	feedback	numbers	for	analysis	to	find	solution
which	operators	can	see	the	response	from	the	statistics	on	the	website
because	every	digital	media	tool	is	used	to	draw	customers	to	the	website	to	make	reservations

cambodia	remains	an	investor	destination	in	the	retail	industry
the	market	is	not	saturated
and	can	also	support	lot	of	growth
although	there	are	many	investors	of	various	nationalities	deciding	to	invest	lot
causing	the	number	of	modern	trade	shops	to	continually	increase
but	the	main	channel	for	cambodians	to	shop	is	still	traditional	markets	while	modern	trade	accounts	for	only	of	the	total	population
most	of	them	are	concentrated	in	the	capital	and	tourist	areas
modern	trade	main	customer	groups	are	young	people	with	high	purchasing	power
and	can	be	open	to	change	as	well	the	scb	eic	said	that	although	cambodia	was	being	revoked	some	of	its	privileges	in	the	eba	from	the	european	union	in	august	but	cambodia	still	has	tax	privileges
generalized	system	of	preferences	gsp	from	the	united	states	and	japan
which	is	huge	market	and	has	high	purchasing	power
in	addition	the	government	has	prepared	an	economic	reform	plan	with	an	industrial	development	plan	that	reduces	dependence	on	exports	of	clothing	and	footwear	products	to
and	promote	renewable	new	industries	emphasize	variety	of	export	products	and	connect	cambodia	industry	with	the	regional	supply	chain

cambodians	are	fond	of	thai	products
especially	consumer	products
absorb	the	products	and	lifestyle	of	thai	people	from	various	entertainment	media
therefore	products	from	thailand	have	an	advantage	over	those	from	other	countries
although	the	prices	of	thai	products	are	higher	than	many	competitors	cambodian	consumers	still	see	the	quality	of	thai	products	that	are	suitable	for	the	price

from	the	analysis	of	the	office	of	international	trade	promotion	in	ho	chi	minh	city	three	factors	and	the	main	reasons	why	vietnam	is	the	leader	in	economic	development	have	been	summarized
the	first	reason	is	because	vietnam	has	stable	government	with	the	communist	socialist	regime	which	plays	role	in	determining	the	direction	of	the	country	administration	in	all	aspects
that	makes	management	run	smoothly	and	emphasis	on	economic	development	and	investor	understanding

coffee	talk	series	ep	the	changing	world	and	technology	are	challenge
but	in	the	challenge	of	new	technology	new	business	models	modern	consumer	with	unique	there	are	still	business	opportunities	that	are	waiting	for	those	who	see	the	opportunity	to	think	dare	to	create	business	always
coffee	talk	ep	opens	new	perspectives	new	opportunities	for	thai	smes	in	aspects	techlife	by	dr	thavicha	trakoolyingyong	from	sansiri	marketing	with	teenagers	by	khun	theppawan	kaninvorapan	from	zapp	and	provincial	marketing	by	khun	marut	choomkuntod	from	class	caf	new	waters	of	creating	value	for	the	business	by	dr	thavicha	trakoolyingyong	how	technology	will	create	new	opportunities
how	to	use	technology	to	strengthen	the	organization
in	this	era	people	who	understand	and	use	technology	and	people	who	understand	but	don	know	how	to	apply	technology	are	having	wider	gap
and	make	the	competition	more	and	more	apart
applying	technology	to	the	business	can	be	seen	in	topics	experience	product	service	business	model
today	the	focus	is	on	areas	customer	experience	and	business	model
customer	experience	is	the	heart	of	doing	business
this	era	goes	beyond	just	want	it	and	want	it	now
but	sometimes	we	must	push	for	customers	too	because	many	times	the	customers	themselves	are	not	sure	what	they	want
we	push	to	drive	their	needs	and	then	buy	products	and	services	from	us
this	can	use	technology	to	do	this	when	customer	buys	drill	he	doesn	need	drill	but	he	needs	hole	and	must	respond	further	to	what	the	hole	will	be	used	for
the	marketer	must	understand	this	because	it	will	refer	to	the	business	model	of	what	to	do
how	can	we	create	better	customer	experience	with	technology
customer	experience	covers	topics	which	are	digital	touchpoints	personalize	seamless	digital	touchpoints	are	the	point	between	customer	interaction	and	us	that	don	need	people
that	has	both	pull	and	push	styles
the	first	form	whether	apps	or	websites	business	owners	must	know	what	to	have	for	can	really	be	used	again
the	first	benefit	of	an	app	or	website	is	to	collect	data	to	understand	customer	behavior	and	needs	for	analysis
another	is	push	such	as	sending	sms	or	various	notifications	to	ensure	that	customers	are	still	with	us
digital	touchpoints
interesting	new	formats	that	help	create	engagement	such	as	google	lens	apps
that	helps	customers	access	to	product	information	easier	faster	just	by	taking	picture
virtual	reality	helps	in	the	navigation	or	that	sansiri	uses	to	decorate	the	house	and	to	place	the	furniture
chatbot	that	works	and	can	become	smarter
and	the	more	used	kiosk	operators	can	collect	data	from	customers	interacting	directly	with	the	kiosk
lastly	is	the	robot	service
using	robots	to	service	more	for	example	sansiri	also	has	nong	san	dee	robots	to	help	deliver	the	products	to	the	residents
to	meet	the	unique	needs	of	each	customer
personalization	must	consider	issues	which	are	specific	content	for	each	client	time	must	be	the	right	timing	pay	attention
because	personalize	has	more	details	that	need	to	be	taken	care	of	must	analyze	data	and	try	many	times	until	it	works
must	trial	to	certain	extent
it	not	just	collected	once	and	is	finished	but	must	be	done	as	journey
seamless	is	challenge	because	consumers	now	have	two	worlds	online	and	offline
how	to	make	the	experience	seamlessly	connected
for	example	customers	have	already	registered	online	but	when	coming	to	the	showroom	they	still	must	fill	out	the	form	again	causing	the	experience	of	the	customers	is	not	continuous
business	modelis	divided	into	types	open	platforms	such	as	grab	airbnb	or	alibaba	are	platforms	that	analyze	and	match	demand	and	supply
this	means	that	there	must	be	some	resources	left	to	be	shared	by	the	supply
belongs	to	anyone	because	it	is	matter	of	sharing
and	the	concept	of	subscription	can	use	but	not	the	owner	and	pay	as	much	as	you	use
close	platform	like	apple	tesla
this	format	will	do	things	themselves	from	upstream	to	downstream
there	are	few	partners	like	apple	all	done	by	themselves	from	product	manufacture	with	their	own	operating	system	and	sales	management
the	idea	that	would	like	to	leave	for	businessman	is	re	define	yourself
what	if	we	were	to	undergo	changes
clearly	define	what	our	value	is	to	create	value	for	customers
what	will	play	big	role	is	that	ai	and	must	think	outside	the	box	propose	new	innovations	and	pay	attention	to	details
defeat	the	teenage	market	battle	with	experience	by	khun	theppawan	kaninvorapan	khun	bass	theppawan	the	first	person	to	hold	zapp	charity	concert	since	the	rd	year	of	university
started	business	for	the	first	time	without	knowledge	then	the	concert	was	not	successful
because	he	mainly	uses	his	own	thoughts	without	thinking	about	the	insight	of	the	target	group	teenagers
but	from	that	day	until	today	entering	the	th	year	over	stages	of	working
the	turning	point	began	with	friends	telling	him	to	try	to	organize	party
by	starting	to	find	insight	from	the	target	group	easily	by	asking	friend	who	drinks	beer	how	much	does	it	cost	per	night
when	friend	tells	me	not	more	than	baht	then	use	this	number	to	determine	the	selling	price	of	the	ticket	at	baht
and	do	more	public	relations	to	attract	by	giving	away	unlimited	beer
from	the	original	plan	target	at	people	but	thousand	people	came	until	the	location	was	not	enough
when	working	more	learning	more	insight
knowing	that	many	university	students	are	singles
therefore	organize	single	party	that	is	still	present
last	time	over	people	came
searching	for	new	business	ideas	must	know	what	the	target	group	wants	at	that	time	using	observation	and	analysis
in	making	content	it	can	cover	people	who	are	years	old	from	us	years	older	than	us	and	years	younger	than	us
because	there	are	also	methods	of	telling	stories	and	have	shared	experience
but	if	it	is	another	generation	that	is	farther	away	then	we	must	find	younger	people	to	create	content	that	this	way	of	thinking	gives	us	framework	and	clear	information
the	event	must	have	many	distinct	points
the	idea	came	from	the	customer	paint	point	they	encountered
for	example	thailand	is	tropical	country
the	air	conditioner	wasn	cool	enough
therefore	have	ideas	for	sprinkling	water	like	songkran
turned	out	that	people	like	it	because	they	felt	refreshing
waterzonic	will	be	held	during	the	low	season	which	is	the	rainy	season
because	it	is	the	time	when	other	people	do	not	organize	the	event	including	wanting	to	draw	tourists	into	this	period
which	people	are	not	afraid	of	the	rain	because	the	event	is	already	wet
everyone	is	ready	to	get	wet	and	with	the	concept	of	the	event	is	strong	we	are	not	afraid	that	people	will	not	come
this	must	arise	from	previous	studies	on	whether	people	want	this	or	not	which	begins	with	understanding	customers
if	there	is	clear	focus	we	will	see	the	opportunity
for	zapp	the	focus	is	clearly	teenagers
therefore	resulting	in	new	opportunities	coming
such	as	garena	world	that	own	by	garena	the	famous	online	gaming	company
the	company	came	in	contact	because	they	saw	that	zapp	is	company	that	has	the	expertise	and	focus	on	teenagers
with	the	question	of	whether	years	have	passed	have	thai	teenagers	changed	lot
in	truth	chances	are	always	there
we	change	ourselves
change	is	our	friend	and	we	must	learn	new	things	all	the	time
whatever	the	opportunity	came	seize	it
before	the	thought	that	the	northeastern	style	singer	is	for	old	people
but	when	saw	it	myself	it	was	found	that	the	person	who	loves	this	is	teenager	factory	girls
it	is	mass	market	and	has	to	buy	power
as	soon	as	the	concert	was	played	everyone	put	their	mobile	phones	and	live	on	facebook
so	saw	that	this	was	an	opportunity
that	why	started	organizing	northeastern	style	singer	concert	which	was	the	thing	that	dont	have	any	knowledge	of
therefore	he	assigned	the	security	officer	in	front	of	the	office	to	be	the	project	leader	which	is	considered	an	opportunity	for	him
must	believe	that	he	can	do	must	give	him	chance	first	which	brings	something	new	that	has	never	been	seen	before
the	concert	entitled	luk	isan	has	very	hit	strategy	do	not	sell	ticket	just	add	line	and	join	for	free	but	there	are	still	more	than	thousand	people	buying	tickets	at	the	event
so	why	confident	that	the	ticket	price	for	waterzonic	is	as	high	as	three	thousand	baht
teens	will	agree	to	buy	because	it	is	considered	relatively	large	amount	for	teenagers
the	answer	is	that	teenagers	who	like	this	type	of	international	event	will	have	purchasing	power
and	the	price	compared	to	the	same	work	in	other	countries	is	considered	cheaper
combined	with	the	expense	of	the	event	is	very	high	only	the	cost	for	the	dj	is	very	high	already	million	baht
therefore	cannot	charge	lower	price	for	ticket
the	secret	to	managing	company	that	has	teenagers	is	to	think	that	we	are	teenagers
importantly	must	listen	to	them
don	tell	him	what	to	do
must	change	to	ask	the	opinion	about	what	to	do	in	the	project
ask	for	his	opinion	first
when	he	raises	his	hand	in	response	to	the	small	things	he	will	become	more	confident
being	teenager	is	looking	for	confidence	and	independence
we	will	get	more	enthusiasm	for	work	and	more	good	ideas	from	listening	to	him
must	forget	that	we	are	adults
new	battlefield	conquering	the	hearts	of	the	provinces	with	technology	by	khun	marut	choomkuntod	this	is	fun	time	for	little	person	who	wants	to	start	something	new
it	an	era	full	of	opportunities
some	people	say	that	business	is	bad	currently	but	it	is	the	period	when	ordinary	people	have	strange	opportunities	to	happen
there	is	matter	of	disrupting	big	companies	adjusting	in	large	numbers	many	number	one	businesses	are	leaving	number	and	number	more	and	more
now	number	one	is	not	afraid	of	number	but	worried	about	the	new	wave	coming	from	nowhere
for	example	eleven	is	not	afraid	of	familymart	but	afraid	of	lazada	or	lineman
people	order	beer	order	water	order	rice	and	don	buy	themselves	at	the	store
today	we	are	racing	driving	car	then	big	bike	overtaking	and	then	disappearing
because	big	bike	has	no	limitations
he	entered	the	niche	that	we	couldn	go	to
this	is	new	world	of	competition
if	we	are	coffee	shop	we	will	compete	with	number	one	that	is	million	times	bigger	than	us
there	is	no	chance
if	we	act	like	him	all	along	we	will	never	be	able	to	tell	who	we	are
business	that	cannot	make	difference	is	very	dangerous
the	beginning	of	the	first	class	caf	branch	in	korat
instead	of	running	to	open	in	bangkok	instead	choosing	to	expand	to	northeastern	thailand	buriram	khon	kaen	udon	thani	is	following	the	high	speed	train	route
choose	markets	that	people	overlook
the	isan	region	has	many	people
found	that	the	markets	that	people	don	care	about	create	huge	opportunity
after	opening	the	first	branch	in	korat	began	to	change	the	concept	that	instead	of	expanding	branches	to	many	cities	each	branch	to	cover	as	much	as	possible	throughout	thailand	but	rethink	by	opening	many	branches	in	one	city
try	opening	shops	on	the	opposite	of	each	other	because	studying	that	one	side	of	the	customer	won	turn	the	car	back	on	the	other	side	and	found	that	true
and	this	makes	management	easier	began	try	to	open	branches	only	meters	apart	found	that	it	is	possible	because	the	customers	are	different	target	groups
the	people	eating	in	the	mall	and	the	street	diner	have	different	styles	of	life
after	opening	branches	try	changing	the	concept	of	being	startup
in	which	the	startup	will	grow	in	the	curve
formerly	class	grew	in	linear
began	to	introduce	the	concept	of	co	working	space	because	the	coffee	business	alone	wasn	interesting
once	the	trend	of	co	working	space	with	startup	came	to	understand	more	data
for	example	in	an	hour	how	many	people	are	connected	to	the	store	wifi
found	that	more	people	come	online	at	the	class	so	think	about	it
if	you	want	customers	to	stay	in	the	store	for	longer	what	we	can	do
what	do	they	want
and	how	to	make	them	come	to	us	early
stay	with	us	comfortably	like	home
this	way	of	thinking	leads	to	new	business	ideas
how	to	get	customers	to	come	and	stay	with	us	days	week	for	hours	day
therefore	need	to	rethink	how	class	can	get	into	his	life
such	as	tissue	paper	that	women	would	keep	in	bag	and	want	class	to	be	with	her	throughout	the	day
once	started	using	the	improved	tissue	paper	as	the	cotton	spectroscopy	the	same	as	the	harrods	department	store
we	wanted	people	to	hold	and	make	the	logo	big	and	clear	in	order	to	be	brand	that	is	in	people	lives
and	how	to	make	it	very	friendly	shop
staff	must	be	humble
do	not	cross	the	line	to	customers	and	not	posing	with	customers
everything	is	very	delicate	for	example	the	temperature	must	be	appropriate	and	must	have	privacy
the	subject	of	user	experience	is	very	important	and	must	have	clear	identity
changed	the	concept	that	coffee	shop	must	be	small	coffee	corner	to	place	larger	than	sqm
to	rai
thinking	how	to	make	us	to	be	more	involved	in	people	daily	lives
began	to	see	people	sitting	watching	movies	or	come	to	wait	for	the	ordered	item	even	come	to	play	the	game
the	idea	of	doing	business	is	an	open	platform	with	partners	that	is	do	not	have	to	do	it	all	yourself
but	allowing	others	who	are	experts	in	each	matter	to	do	everything	is	an	open	coffee	platform
working	with	other	startups	for	example	seekster	takes	care	of	cleanliness
skootar	delivers	coffee	in	bangkok
moved	into	platform	that	is	full	of	opportunities	for	each	expert	to	do	each	thing	creating	new	ecosystem
finding	customer	information	does	not	begin	with	technology	but	starts	with	attention
such	as	observing	why	there	are	no	people	sitting	at	some	point
then	have	the	barista	try	to	sit	on	every	spot	in	the	shop	to	know	why	people	sit	where	more	or	less
technology	is	sometimes	expensive	and	doesn	cause	immediate	sales
but	the	store	decoration	this	furniture	leads	to	immediate	sales
so	just	look	here	first
therefore	data	science	is	not	very	necessary	but	the	barista	that	cares	about	business	and	pays	attention	to	customers	is	worth	paying
if	anything	that	starts	with	our	own	attention	no	one	can	be	against	us
but	technology	comes	to	help	amplify	things	that	we	already	care	about	to	be	easier	when	scale	up
if	we	have	owners	that	are	more	attentive	and	detailed	we	will	be	business	that	others	are	afraid	of
the	key	to	building	successful	sme	business	in	the	digital	disruption	era	can	be	summarized	by	the	three	speakers	real	understanding	of	customers	by	using	information	and	attention	to	create	the	best	experience	and	differentiate	the	business
in	order	to	create	position	and	win	the	hearts	of	customers	in	the	long	run
for	sme
nowadays	the	elderly	society	is	everywhere	which	made	some	people	feel	bad	about	their	age
however	do	not	worry	because	in	the	thai	elderly	ratio	will	be	higher	than	which	will	be	an	attractive	customer	for	every	business
there	is	an	opportunity	in	traveling	business	such	as	long	stay	accommodation	or	long	term	service	and	accommodation	for	tourists
thailand	is	in	many	tourists	dream	list	because	of	japanese	elderly	love	to	be	here
also	chiangmai	is	the	top	destination	and	there	were	over	tourists	that	extended	their	visa	to	stay	last	year
not	only	japanese	but	also	other	countries	tourists
from	the	tourist	behavior	analysis	report	from	center	of	tourism	research	and	development	social	research	institute	chiang	mai	university	found	that	many	international	tourists	such	as	german	american	and	other	european	are	interested	in	spending	their	retirement	in	thailand
so	many	northern	provinces	may	feel	thankful	for	that
from	the	un	aging	statistics	shows	that	persons	are	celebrating	their	birthdays	in	every	seconds	or	you	can	say	that	million	people	are	going	to	be	year	old	in	every	year
this	is	large	number	for	the	market
for	long	stay	business	who	clearly	support	health	service	is	the	most	favorite	for	aging	people	because	most	of	them	has	saved	some	money	for	retirement	from	the	government	service
moreover	asian	elderly	especially	japanese	give	priority	to	health	services	and	worth	cost	living
not	only	long	stay	business	that	grows	strongly	but	also	taking	care	service	for	seniors	does
let	look	in	japanese	society	there	are	many	home	cares	accommodation	rental	and	selling	senior	equipment	shops	and	food	service	for	seniors	which	are	growing	very	fast
some	of	these	businesses	are	already	expanded	to	thailand
this	great	opportunity	also	came	from	the	government	to	support	and	invite	these	elderlies	to	thailand	by	year	free	visa	for	an	older	than	year	old	person	or	non	immigrant	visa	long	stay
also	the	tourism	authority	of	thailand	supports	thai	business	to	match	with	an	international	business	specialist	to	expand	their	knowledge	and	build	up	themselves	to	be	the	stronger	partners
meanwhile	as	you	saw	thai	senior	number	as	we	mentioned	above	they	are	another	attractive	customer	for	much	thai	property	projects	as	they	will	build	an	aging	society	with	many	facilities	in	mountain	range	or	by	the	beach	to	support	those	the	second	home	in	need	with	the	same	age	friends	and	activities
when	it	comes	to	life	age	does	not	matter	reference	scb	helps	you	invest	with	confidence	and	fulfill	your	long	term	financial	goals
the	online	commerce	trend	is	growing	rapidly	around	the	globe
as	the	internet	offers	convenient	means	of	communication	the	digital	world	has	become	significant	part	of	people	lives	today
the	growing	response	to	social	media	communication	is	one	of	the	factors	driving	the	exponential	growth	of	commerce	businesses	in	myanmar
the	people	of	myanmar	today	are	familiar	with	buying	and	selling	online	due	to	convenient	internet	access
survey	conducted	by	the	government	has	shown	that	there	were	total	of	million	phone	numbers	accounting	for	of	myanmars	total	population	of	million
this	statistic	means	that	some	are	using	more	than	one	mobile	phone	reflecting	how	greatly	better	communications	have	influenced	the	people	of	myanmar
in	the	past	it	was	quite	difficult	to	own	phone	number	as	sim	cards	were	costly
however	sim	cards	are	much	cheaper	nowadays	and	most	people	own	smartphones
with	internet	and	telephone	networks	in	myanmar	access	to	the	internet	via	smartphones	has	become	way	of	life	especially	in	the	city	of	yangon	where	covers	of	the	area	ranking	in	the	top	four	in	asean	after	thailand	singapore	and	indonesia
another	survey	by	datareportal	revealed	that	there	were	million	internet	users	as	of	january	and	most	of	them	use	social	media	as	their	primary	medium
in	the	government	focused	on	promoting	the	development	of	the	digital	economy	by	determining	the	myanmar	digital	economy	roadmap	and	forming	digital	economy	development	committee	dedc	in	an	effort	to	drive	the	nations	digital	economy	forward
according	to	the	plan	the	government	will	focus	on	nine	key	sectors	comprising	education	health	agriculture	sector	fisheries	and	livestock	tourism	manufacturing	and	smes	financial	services	technology	sector	and	startup	promotion	commerce	and	transportation	and	logistics	by	aiming	to	increase	online	transactions	in	parallel	with	the	development	of	the	network
moreover	online	business	will	be	embraced	as	means	to	save	the	environment	reduce	pollution	and	reduce	the	need	for	new	buildings
the	myanmar	times	also	reported	the	increasing	popularity	of	social	media	usage	such	as	facebook	including	entertainment	streaming	services	like	netflix	viu	iflix	and	joox	or	arcade	for	games
apart	from	facebooks	marketplaces	the	top	four	popular	websites	ranked	by	myanmar	as	of	april	used	by	myanmar	entrepreneurs	and	retailers	to	promote	and	sell	their	products	online	are	it	is	evident	that	the	people	of	myanmar	have	strongly	embraced	online	habits
they	have	fully	taken	advantage	of	internet	access	and	modern	communication	technology	in	their	daily	lives	with	online	shopping	gaining	popularity
myanmar	is	becoming	new	destination	for	foreign	investors	with	increasing	employment	and	wages
these	positive	factors	are	favorable	for	thai	entrepreneurs	keen	to	invest	in	myanmar	which	is	becoming	more	and	more	lucrative	market	enjoying	growing	purchasing	power
siam	commercial	bank	is	the	only	thai	bank	granted	license	to	establish	wholly	owned	subsidiary	bank	by	the	central	bank	of	myanmar

the	continuously	growing	economic	outlook	has	seen	cambodia	becoming	an	asean	country	to	watch	in	terms	of	trade	and	investment
importantly	the	government	has	promoted	infrastructure	projects	such	as	airports	electric	trains	and	roads	to	support	economic	growth
another	indicator	indicating	progress	is	the	healthcare	business
currently	cambodia	boasts	several	world	class	hospitals	such	as	the	royal	phnom	penh	hospital	and	royal	angkor	international	hospital
dr	narintara	boonjongcharoen	managing	director	hospital	director	ppms	will	discuss	the	cambodian	economy	in	terms	of	the	healthcare	perspective	with	cambodian	commercial	bank	director	and	general	manager	pakaravee	anantathananid
cambodia	exponential	social	and	economic	growth	prior	to	the	covid	pandemic	cambodia	with	of	its	population	of	million	of	working	age	averaged	gdp	growth	per	year	mainly	from	exports	of	apparel	and	textiles	agriculture	tourism	and	foreign	investment	and	trade	especially	from	chinese	investors
this	led	to	leap	in	the	availability	of	consumer	goods	and	socio	economic	expansion
in	the	world	bank	raised	cambodia	from	low	income	country	to	middle	low	income	country
in	the	past	few	years	high	rise	buildings	have	been	built	in	big	cities	like	phnom	penh	and	sihanoukville	and	popular	restaurants	hotels	and	retailer	franchises	have	been	established	in	the	kingdom
according	to	pakaravee	the	outbreak	of	the	coronavirus	has	seriously	affected	cambodia
previously	there	were	concerns	that	the	european	union	would	revoke	cambodia	from	the	everything	but	arms	eba	preferential	tax	scheme	providing	tax	privileges	for	cambodias	textile	exports	to	the	eu
the	incentive	was	discontinued	in	august	amid	concerns	that	the	nation	would	lose	its	competitiveness
however	it	was	covid	not	the	eba	that	instead	stalled	the	cambodian	economy
for	example	by	prompting	reduced	demand	for	apparel	in	the	global	market	and	slowdown	in	foreign	investment	especially	from	china	including	tourism	which	comprised	approximately	one	fourth	of	the	country	gdp
in	the	government	estimated	gdp	growth	of	minus	while	in	the	imf	world	bank	projected	cambodia	economy	growing	by
the	forecast	came	just	before	the	country	was	hit	by	third	wave	of	the	coronavirus	in	february
therefore	the	efficiency	of	the	cambodian	government	in	handling	the	new	outbreak	will	determine	whether	the	economy	will	grow	as	expected	or	not
an	insight	into	the	healthcare	business	in	cambodia	with	positive	perspective	on	cambodias	cultural	and	historical	tourism	bdms	hospital	chain	founder	dr	prasert	prasarttong	osoth	has	identified	business	opportunities	in	cambodia	beginning	with	an	opening	of	bangkok	airways	route	to	siem	reap	where	the	world	heritage	site	of	angkor	wat	is	located
before	the	covid	pandemic	cambodia	was	the	fastest	growing	economy	in	asean	and	it	is	expected	to	recover	once	the	crisis	is	over
dr	narintara	shared	an	overview	of	cambodian	business	in	the	post	khmer	rouge	era	during	which	cambodia	medical	and	healthcare	system	was	destroyed
when	the	economy	started	to	improve	medical	services	were	not	sufficient	to	meet	demand	and	cambodians	seeking	medical	care	were	often	forced	to	seek	treatment	abroad	in	such	countries	as	thailand	vietnam	and	singapore
thailand	alone	accepted	all	types	of	patients	from	cambodia	at	both	public	and	private	hospitals	in	bangkok	and	border	provinces	creating	medical	diaspora	of	those	seeking	medical	care	unavailable	in	cambodia
cambodias	public	health	system	is	partly	supported	by	france	which	can	accommodate	certain	demands
however	there	have	been	substantial	unmet	demands	among	more	affluent	people	who	are	willing	to	pay	more	for	better	treatment
this	presented	good	opportunity	for	the	bdms	group	to	open	the	internationally	accredited	royal	phnom	penh	hospital	and	royal	angkor	international	hospital	as	alternative	choices	for	those	who	can	afford	treatment	at	those	establishments	including	businessmen	and	foreign	tourists	who	previously	had	to	travel	abroad	to	seek	medical	treatment
currently	the	cambodian	government	is	trying	to	establish	social	security	system
the	public	healthcare	system	offers	basic	treatment	at	village	or	district	hospitals
as	cambodia	is	classified	as	low	income	country	there	are	hospitals	established	in	the	form	of	foundations	by	non	profit	organizations	from	abroad	and	major	hospitals	also	received	donations	from	abroad
china	is	the	main	country	providing	assistance	to	cambodia	through	the	government	and	its	ministry	of	defense
the	number	of	hospitals	serving	basic	needs	is	sufficient
however	there	may	still	be	some	gaps	in	terms	of	quality	and	satisfaction	compared	to	other	countries
during	the	pandemic	the	royal	phnom	penh	hospital	was	the	first	hospital	in	phnom	penh	to	accept	covid	patients	working	closely	with	the	who	and	the	cambodian	authorities	to	offer	high	standard	of	infection	prevention	and	readiness
covid	situation	in	cambodia	cambodias	first	covid	patient	was	chinese	citizen	who	visited	sihanoukville
at	that	time	the	impact	was	still	limited
the	next	case	was	japanese	businessman	who	traveled	back	from	siem	reap	to	japan	and	was	detected	by	authorities	in	siem	reap
the	royal	angkor	international	hospital	organized	team	with	who	cdc	us	embassy	uk	embassy	and	siem	reap	authorities	to	conduct	contact	testing	take	care	of	covid	patients	and	prevent	further	infection
the	third	case	was	british	patient	infected	in	kampong	cham	who	was	admitted	to	the	royal	phnom	penh	hospital	which	was	ready	to	accept	covid	patients
however	people	panicked	about	the	emerging	disease	when	it	first	arrived
in	march	people	would	not	come	to	the	hospital	despite	the	royal	phnom	penh	hospital	is	able	to	accept	covid	patients
dr	narintara	believed	that	the	hospitals	medical	standards	were	able	to	deal	with	the	disease	with	its	specialized	doctors	medical	staff	equipment	ppe	suits	and	medicine
at	the	same	time	the	hospital	worked	closely	with	other	bdms	hospitals	the	who	and	the	cdc	to	continually	assess	the	situation
since	then	more	than	ten	foreign	patients	have	been	treated
over	the	course	of	there	were	over	covid	cases	in	cambodia	without	any	fatal	cases
the	government	appointed	royal	phnom	penh	hospital	as	covid	test	and	treatment	center
during	the	third	wave	of	the	outbreak	the	bdms	hospital	group	reduced	its	role	since	february	and	the	cambodian	government	has	established	funds	for	constructing	field	hospitals	for	comprehensive	covid	treatment	which	have	been	well	managed
currently	the	royal	phnom	penh	hospital	treats	both	general	and	covid	patients	with	support	from	the	bdms	group
the	hospital	is	ready	to	adapt	to	changing	situations
last	year	business	was	positive	with	earnings	among	the	top	for	the	group
despite	lockdowns	both	hospitals	continue	to	operate	quite	well	compared	to	other	businesses
the	cambodian	government	has	demonstrated	that	the	situation	is	under	control	with	widespread	vaccination	ranking	second	in	asean	after	singapore
businesses	have	adapted	to	the	existence	of	covid	and	cambodia	is	ready	to	move	forward	to	reopen	the	country	and	develop	the	economy	for	quick	recovery
vaccination	in	cambodia	pakaravee	sees	cambodia	as	being	strong	in	handling	and	preventing	the	pandemic
the	government	has	acquired	million	doses	of	vaccines	prioritizing	those	living	in	the	capital	phnom	penh	before	expanding	to	major	cities	such	as	sihanoukville
another	strong	point	about	cambodias	efficient	handling	of	the	pandemic	is	the	issuance	of	legislation	mandating	all	military	and	police	officers	justice	officers	and	political	officials	to	receive	the	vaccination
if	they	do	not	cooperate	their	jobs	will	be	in	jeopardy
foreign	workers	with	work	permits	were	also	vaccinated	along	with	cambodians
foreigners	can	also	buy	covid	insurance	and	the	government	requires	all	arriving	foreigners	to	policy
however	insurance	is	not	popular	among	local	people	as	the	premiums	are	considered	high	but	the	business	is	on	an	uptrend
government	support	during	the	pandemic	the	national	bank	of	cambodia	has	issued	measures	to	support	financial	institutions	such	as	reducing	capital	reserves	increasing	liquidity	and	encourage	banks	to	support	entrepreneurs	by	extending	loan	repayment	terms	and	restructuring	loans	up	to	three	times
in	the	beginning	support	was	provided	only	to	four	segments	directly	affected	by	the	outbreak	comprising	the	tourism	textiles	construction	and	logistics	sectors
later	all	businesses	were	allowed	to	seek	assistance	at	the	discretion	of	banks
the	measure	was	announced	in	march	and	ended	in	december	but	was	extended	until	june	and	may	be	further	extended	until	the	end	of	recommendation	for	potential	investors	seeking	to	invest	in	cambodia	according	to	dr	narintara	cambodia	is	country	with	strong	potential	to	become	growth	generator	in	the	future	due	to	its	small	population	mostly	young	people	and	children
its	strong	alliance	with	china	has	played	part	in	enhancing	the	country	development	such	as	new	airports	to	be	constructed	in	phnom	penh	siem	reap	and	sihanoukville	and	the	development	of	sihanoukville	along	lines	similar	to	shenzhen	which	is	expected	to	house	the	digital	industry
the	change	is	expected	to	rebrand	sihanoukvilles	image	from	casino	city	to	high	tech	city	and	an	outlet	for	china
from	historical	perspective	china	and	cambodia	have	been	close	since	ancient	times
in	the	past	cambodia	served	as	china	port	for	shipments	to	india	the	malay	peninsula	and	indonesia
in	addition	cambodia	has	received	large	investments	and	grants	for	infrastructure	projects	from	south	korea	and	japan	proof	that	cambodia	will	develop	even	further	post	pandemic
the	healthcare	business	in	cambodia	is	also	attractive	as	singapore	will	be	joining	the	market
the	royal	phnom	penh	hospital	has	also	been	announced	as	medical	hub	in	indochina	with	future	investment	plans
dr	narintara	added	that	cambodias	digital	economy	at	present	features	wide	range	of	digital	banking	that	has	been	widely	adopted	for	money	transfers	and	payments
cambodia	has	the	potential	for	exponential	growth	and	with	the	country	being	in	the	early	stages	of	development	it	offers	many	opportunities	for	entrepreneurs	who	make	the	first	move
ccb	supports	investment	as	an	scb	subsidiary	the	cambodian	commercial	bank	or	ccb	has	been	in	business	for	over	years

scb	overseas	branch	network	is	ready	to	support	and	provide	services
from	the	study	by	the	national	statistic	office	there	are	thais	who	are	not	able	to	receive	the	basic	monetary	service
by	looking	closer	of	the	population	or	million	people	cannot	access	the	loan	service	provided	by	institutions
this	fact	raises	the	question	of	whether	these	people	are	really	not	qualified	and	how	likely	are	they	to	be	able	to	receive	the	monetary	service
thiranun	arunwattanakul	neung	coo	of	monix	co	ltd	which	is	company	under	scb	shares	with	us	about	the	product	aiming	to	provide	access	to	the	formal	loan	to	the	low	income	earner	and	the	new	ways	of	working	with	the	monix	style
getting	to	know	monix	monix	the	jv	of	scb	and	abakus	chinese	leading	technological	company	focuses	on	digital	lending	service	for	people	with	no	access	to	the	basic	financial	system	by	utilizing	the	needs	of	customers	to	design	products	and	services
as	the	bank	aims	for	long	term	digital	lending	service	growth	monix	is	held	by	scb	and	held	by	abakus	ltd	micro	lending	the	product	which	helps	low	income	earners	access	the	loan	monixs	main	objective	is	to	provide	the	solution	to	low	income	people	freelancers	and	hand	to	mount	people
these	people	are	rejected	when	applying	for	the	formal	loan	as	they	fail	to	provide	their	financial	statement	or	payslip	which	costs	them	the	opportunity	to	access	the	formal	loan	and	forces	them	to	get	the	service	from	loan	sharks	which	are	risky	and	high	interest	charged
these	are	the	reasons	why	these	people	cannot	escape	the	loan	shark	system
micro	lending	service	is	designed	to	provide	more	access	to	formal	loans	for	these	people
it	is	small	loan	that	can	be	maximized	to	thousand	thai	baht
such	service	can	be	accessed	through	an	application	called	ha	hi	money
easily	apply	for	micro	lending	through	the	application	for	the	convenience	of	customers	the	ha	hi	money	application	can	be	instantly	downloaded	and	the	service	can	be	applied
applying	for	the	loan	is	just	similar	to	other	institutions	but	requires	fewer	documents
the	customer	is	required	to	fill	in	the	information	and	agrees	to	disclose	the	personal	information	of	daily	income	and	outcome	for	example	water	bill	the	electric	bill	and	telephone	bill	to	let	the	company	get	to	know	the	customer	for	the	risk	assessment	process
the	appropriate	loan	amount	and	install	payment	period	is	then	identified	from	the	customers	paying	ability
neung	mentions	that	customers	can	be	assured	that	the	interest	charged	and	the	debt	collectors	are	legally	abided
customers	then	will	have	more	confidence	in	their	financial	discipline	and	do	not	have	the	forever	bonded	debt	the	monix	styled	new	ways	of	working	monix	works	against	time
being	asked	what	the	monix	styled	new	ways	of	working	is	neung	answers	that	working	at	monix	is	finding	the	fastest	way	to	receive	customers	feedback	to	assure	that	it	is	truly	the	customers	need
the	taskforce	then	tries	to	find	the	quickest	way	to	launch	the	product	which	the	thinking	process	has	to	be	efficient	but	fast	seeking	the	possibility	and	meeting	with	the	customer	to	test	the	idea
the	simplified	and	easily	made	prototype	is	preferred
as	the	idea	testing	can	be	done	quickly	ideas	are	then	reduced	to	this	eliminates	the	meeting	room	session
then	analyzing	how	to	make	the	ideas	happen	is	the	next	step
as	the	work	is	needed	to	be	quick	and	always	meet	new	challenges	neung	mentions	that	the	team	is	required	to	have	mindset	of	speed	quick	flexible	and	quickly	adapt	changing	is	natural	attitude	enjoy	the	changes	and	eager	to	learn	empathy	understand	customers
neung	also	emphasizes	when	meeting	customers	if	they	ask	new	questions	or	have	new	issue	which	was	unasked	it	is	important	to	collect	the	idea	for	the	learning	curve
listening	to	customers	needs	and	analyzing	them	do	not	only	listen	to	what	we	would	like	to	know
data	is	the	heart	of	product	development	nowadays	several	organizations	utilize	data	to	set	their	business	strategy	analyze	the	market	and	gain	customer	insight
at	monix	data	is	used	in	dimensions
the	first	dimension	is	to	assess	the	customers	ability	to	pay	back	the	loan
the	second	is	to	evaluate	customer	financial	discipline	and	their	daily	lifestyle	for	instance	bike	fare	food	fare	delivery	price	telephone	bill
therefore	it	can	be	seen	that	the	micro	lending	group	does	not	have	these	transactions	with	the	banks
to	be	able	to	access	such	data	partnering	with	the	business	with	ecosystem	plays	an	important	role	for	example	partnering	with	to	access	the	telephone	bill	data	either	prepaid	or	postpaid	service	provide	behavioral	insight	of	the	customers
as	monix	needs	personal	data	to	analyze	the	loan	the	company	is	regulated	by	the	personal	data	protection	act	pdpa
neung	emphasizes	that	the	pdpa	forces	the	company	to	be	more	careful	on	personal	data	collection	pieces	of	information	were	collected	in	the	past	but	with	the	pdpa	information	collected	is	minimized
the	usage	of	the	data	requires	clear	objective	that	is	considered	to	be	respected
hence	the	business	can	be	conducted	with	the	pdpa	presence	as	the	customers	still	need	the	appropriate	products	and	services
perspective	on	new	normal	neung	has	believed	since	before	the	pandemic	that	changes	occur	continuously	however	at	an	unnoticeable	rate
facing	the	pandemic	can	be	considered	as	pulling	the	cord	forcing	sudden	changes
the	new	normal	is	the	change	in	peoples	behavior
for	business	wise	new	normal	is	different	among	businesses
therefore	the	behavior	and	location	changes	of	the	customers	are	required	to	be	taken	into	account
it	cannot	be	thought	the	same	way	for	example	the	brick	and	mortar	store	is	not	required	for	the	online	customer	business
before	leaving	neung	passes	good	thought	to	other	business	owners	during	this	pandemic	time	that	everyone	is	facing	the	same	problem	at	the	same	time
the	encouragement	can	be	found	anywhere
thai	people	are	kind	as	we	can	see	that	many	businesses	have	turned	to	sell	food	and	people	are	helping	to	buy	them
after	the	pandemic	preparation	for	the	new	normal	is	required
please	keep	in	mind	that	discipline	is	what	helps	us	get	through	the	pandemic
emergency	saving	needs	to	be	reserved
utilizing	new	technologies	could	benefit	in	cost	and	expense	reduction
finally	business	owners	need	to	understand	customers	behavior	being	where	the	customers	are	is	the	key	to	keep	the	business	growing	and	successful

the	true	story	that	international	businesspeople	face	although	trade	fairs	or	trade	shows	will	still	be	magical	most	exporters	still	use	trade	fair	to	open	new	markets	and	find	new	partners
however	the	limitations	or	pain	points	of	the	fair	trade	event	are	quite	lot
khun	theetipun	theppadungporn	tells	us	about	the	trade	fair	limitations	both	the	cost	is	quite	high	and	have	to	spend	lot	of	time	traveling	and	the	time	required	to	prepare
while	in	the	end	there	may	not	be	anything	back	to	hand	at	all	is	it	still	worthwhile	to	go	to	the	trade	fair
on	this	day	there	is	new	channel	that	does	not	require	fee
don	have	to	travel	do	not	waste	time	preparing	for	long	time
but	can	contact	to	negotiate	business	anywhere	anytime	with	screening	partner	that	is	trusted	from	all	over	the	world	that	is	ready	to	become	new	member	of	your	business	family
traditional	market	expansion	may	is	not	the	answer	normally	if	it	is	new	country	we	will	find	new	markets	by	trade	shows	at	various	countries	each	time	it	takes	quite	bit	of	preparation	and	the	past	customers	will	get	some	not	some
sometimes	going	to	close	cases	each	time	something	like	that
khun	theetipun	theppadungporn	international	marketing	manager	the	manufacturer	coconut	milk	chaokoh	that	thai	people	are	familiar	with	and	have	been	paired	with	thai	kitchens	for	generations	talked	about	joining	trade	fair	to	find	new	markets	and	find	new	partners
each	visit	is	expensive	and	requires	months	of	preparation	and	sometimes	not	getting	new	partner	back	at	all
each	trade	fair	will	encounter	many	problems
sometimes	there	are	lot	of	customers	coming	in	to	contact	you	but	not	really	customers	who	want	products
some	of	us	might	want	to	come	in	to	compare	prices	or	come	in	to	ask	for	information	only
khun	thee	said
he	goes	on	to	tell	the	latest	trade	fair	in	canada	market	that	the	company	has	not	visited	for	many	years	and	there	is	not	much	information	to	use	that	preparation	for	quite	long	time	it	is	difficult	to	go	by	yourself	when	traveling	or	preparing	products
and	the	result	did	not	reach	the	expected	target	the	deal	cannot	be	closed	because	it	is	not	confident	in	the	credit	of	the	partner	khun	thee	said	that	one	reason	why	the	deal	is	difficult	to	close	is	since	the	company	selects	potential	partners
who	able	to	understand	the	business	of	the	company	reasonably
most	of	all	is	like	we	know	person
we	just	know	him
we	don	know	that	how	is	the	background
how	is	his	financial	status
how	reliable
we	cannot	make	an	immediate	decision	and	therefore	must	spend	time	studying	him
and	since	the	company	focuses	on	doing	business	with	partners	in	the	long	run	it	is	also	important	to	look	at	what	their	business	is
are	they	familiar	with	the	company	products	or	products	from	asia
what	are	the	experience	the	company	size	and	financial	status
are	they	able	to	run	your	business	in	the	long	run
and	the	risk	of	doing	business	together
he	thinks	that	starting	business	is	not	very	difficult	but	to	do	business	together	in	the	long	run	is	not	an	easy	task	must	study	well
would	it	be	better	to	have	tool	to	verify	the	partner	background
khun	thee	told	that	if	it	is	difficult	for	the	company	to	check	the	information	of	the	partners	themselves	it	is	quite	difficult
therefore	the	company	usually	does	not	give	credit	to	new	partners
must	have	them	transfer	money	at	first	to	ensure	that	will	get	money
but	if	there	is	helper	such	as	scb	trade	club	to	help	provide	information	of	partners	and	banks	help	to	screen	as	reliable	trader	and	have	good	credit
you	are	very	helpful	in	doing	business
think	it	good	because	the	trade	club	helps	us	to	see	the	data	from	our	partners
we	see	his	company	information	about	what	areas	of	expertise	they	have
how	is	his	financial	status	it	can	help	reduce	the	time	in	our	process
as	usual	sometimes	we	don	have	trade	club
we	try	to	do	business	ourselves	it	may	take	year	or	two	to	see	what	their	potential	is
his	financial	position	we	sell	products
will	they	have	money	to	pay	for	us
but	when	there	is	trade	club	there	are	other	banks	to	help	choose	we	can	be	comfortable	in	this	matter
because	in	the	past	have	found	case	that	has	been	deformed	such	as	having	already	ordered	items
when	the	goods	arrive	at	the	port	instead	of	not	picking	up	the	goods	it	causes	damage	to	the	company	and	must	waste	time	searching	for	other	partners	to	pick	up	this	product	instead
which	although	these	events	may	be	commonplace	for	export	businesses	to	encounter	having	method	to	select	more	good	partners	in	the	beginning	so	that	entrepreneurs	can	protect	themselves	from	potential	risks	and	most	importantly	not	losing	business	opportunities	is	therefore	very	important	the	faster	you	know	information	the	better	your	advantage	the	competitors	when	we	do	business	each	country	has	different	requirements
the	use	of	documents	that	are	not	the	same	in	each	country	we	need	to	prepare	what	documents	to	register	import	products
it	is	also	quite	difficult	for	us	to	keep	updating	his	laws	about	how	each	country	is	using
it	is	also	quite	difficult	for	us	to	keep	updating	his	laws	about	how	each	country	is	using
because	now	the	longer	we	sell	in	more	countries	it	makes	us	not	follow	each	country	in	time
khun	thee	tell	us	about	the	problem	of	data	import	regulations	in	each	country	that	are	different	and	constantly	changing
even	if	it	is	strange	country	that	has	been	encountered	such	as	egypt	or	africa	that	requires	lot	of	documents	it	takes	long	time
or	sometimes	contacting	partners	there	for	difficult	assistance	therefore	requires	studying	and	understand	all	the	laws	and	regulations	which	will	take	quite	long	time	khun	thee	gives	example	changing	the	import	regulations	that	affect	business
such	as	cases	in	myanmar	that	originally	accepted	packaging	in	the	thai	language	but	later	changing	to	the	new	rules	that	packaging	to	be	sent	into	myanmar	must	have	the	burmese	language	as	well	then	cannot	put	the	sticker	on	it
this	is	case	that	is	difficult	and	time	consuming	because	it	must	make	new	packaging	specifically	for	myanmar	despite	not	being	large	market	with	many	sales
every	second	wasted	affects	the	business	because	time	is	precious	thing	for	entrepreneurs
the	sooner	know	the	easier	it	is	for	us	to	work
in	terms	of	duration	also	the	cost	is	also	economical	because	we	can	plan	when	we	will	start	using	the	new	items
do	we	still	have	old	stock
if	there	is	we	can	manage	all	of	it	first	and	then	we	can	use	new	things
it	is	considered	matter	of	time	as	well	as	saving	for	us	as	well
because	if	we	stop	walking	competitors	are	ready	to	overtake	us	all	the	time	therefore	if	there	is	an	online	platform	that	gathers	information	and	updates	the	laws	of	different	countries
complete	details	such	as	the	trade	portal	which	is	part	of	the	scb	trade	club	will	save	both	time	and	labor	in	studying	the	entrepreneurs	themselves
which	makes	management	more	efficient	because	good	partners	are	like	family	like	we	have	representatives	to	set	up	companies	in	each	country
having	good	partner	or	partner	that	can	present	our	products	correctly	can	help	build	sales	for	us	it	is	like	being	part	of	family	that	is	ready	to	grow	together
scb	trade	club	is	ready	to	help	entrepreneurs	ensure	that	business	partners	who	are	part	of	the	business	family	have	good	background	and	credibility
without	wasting	time	trial	and	error
or	waste	time	studying	for	years	and	found	later	that	the	wrong	partner	was	chosen	at	first	which	is	very	waste	of	business	opportunity	because	every	minute	has	meaning	for	your	growth
business	customers	who	are	interested	in	becoming	part	of	the	global	business	network	scb	trade	club	can	request	the	business	relations	manager	or	scb	business	call	center
scb	trade	club	scb	business	call	center	the	global	trade	platform	designed	to	help	your	business	expand	internationally
with	more	than	decades	of	experience	in	the	organization	being	an	sme	entrepreneur	startup	that	penetrates	the	market	mr	phathai	phadungthin	ceo	of	builk	one	group	shared	his	vision	of	making	crm	in	business	that	is	more	than	just	customer	data	store
but	with	today	digital	technology	the	crm	platform	has	become	tool	to	develop	sales	team	potential
create	amazing	business	results
ciel	vs	pipm	khun	phathai	said	about	the	nature	of	start	up	business	that	it	focuses	on	rapid	growth	innovation	creativity
which	is	different	from	doing	an	sme	business	which	can	be	based	on	the	theory	of	hermawan	kartajaya	the	top	marketer	who	co	authored	the	book	marketing	on	ciel	and	pimp	skills	that	are	essential	to	management
but	with	the	skills	that	are	at	different	poles	corporate	executives	need	to	balance	skills	on	both	sides	of	the	equation
for	the	organization	to	move	forward	the	details	of	ciel	and	pimp	are	as	follows	creativity	innovation	leadership	productivityi	improvement	professionalism	management	ciel	skills	are	used	lot	in	start	up	businesses	using	creativity	to	create	something	new
develop	innovation	owner	of	the	management	doing	everything	by	hand	and	use	leadership	to	decide	every	detail
all	these	contrast	with	pimp	skills	that	are	guidelines	for	managing	smes	or	organizations	with	clear	kpis	that	measure	productivity	using	improvements	to	build	on	from	the	old	ones
professional	management	professionalism	and	work	systematically	management	when	was	startup	will	focus	on	creativity	create	new	things
but	it	may	not	answer	the	question	of	productivity	startups	create	innovations	but	smes	will	build	on	the	old	ones
entrepreneurs	do	everything	themselves
but	as	the	company	grows	it	must	hire	professionals	to	help	manage	it
and	work	systematically	said	khun	phathai
what	are	the	characteristics	of	business
as	khun	phathai	has	been	in	the	business	all	along	mr	pai	sees	that	the	specifics	of	doing	business	are	how	long	it	takes	to	close	the	sale	involves	multiple	departments	has	planning	and	decision	making	process
the	products	in	the	business	are	divided	into	groups	products	with	high	complexity	high	selling	price	projects	and	systems	for	governments	large	corporations	consulting	sales
it	takes	long	time	to	close	the	sale

because	some	new	normal	businesses	will	not	go	back	as	before	the	crisis	because	the	structure	of	demand	supply	demand	supply	will	change	completely
and	what	strategy	will	be	prepared	to	handle	when	that	event	arrives
where	is	thailand	in	the	crisis	of	the	covid
in	the	opinion	of	bcg	the	situation	of	covid	is	divided	into	phases	namely	flatten	who	was	clearly	in	recession
because	the	number	of	people	infected	is	steadily	increasing
the	next	phase	is	fight	the	fight	phase	is	turning	point	before	reaching	the	future	or	the	future	phase	in	which	everything	will	return	as	before
which	in	this	fight	phase	is	dangerous	periodically	fearless	as	if	driving	at	dusk	don	know	how	to	proceed
moving	forward	is	not	sure
if	you	stop	waiting	you	may	lose	the	opportunity	for	competitors
thailand	is	currently	in	the	flatten	phase	before	entering	the	fight	phase
khun	isada	commented	that	when	entering	the	fight	phase	most	people	think	that	the	business	sector	is	open	everything	will	return	as	before
but	from	many	countries	that	have	unlocked	the	down	then	there	is	chance	that	covid	will	return	to	the	nd	round
this	may	cause	more	damage	than	the	first	round	therefore	even	after	returning	to	open	the	city	it	still	cannot	be	trusted
as	for	the	question	of	how	long	thailand	is	in	danger	the	answer	is	can	medicine	be	treated
for	example	when	new	flu	pandemic	found	tamiflu	drug	that	is	effective	for	treating	having	vaccine	to	prevent	the	covid	virus	if	there	are	no	two	of	the	above	waiting	for	herd	immunity	will	take	quite	long	time
according	to	the	latest	bcg	data	from	early	may	it	is	expected	that	the	fastest	effective	medication	to	be	released	is	another	months
the	vaccine	is	expected	to	take	around	months	because	after	the	fda	has	passed	the	mass	production	process	and	distributed	to	countries	around	the	world
therefore	in	the	next	months	we	still	must	be	in	fearful	state	fight	phase
after	unlocking	will	the	economy	recover
as	for	the	impact	on	the	thai	economy	the	scb	eic	business	economics	research	center	forecasts	negative	gdp	numbers	of
which	if	the	city	opens	in	this	quarter	the	economy	should	improve
in	this	section	bcg	sees	economic	recovery	difficult	to	predict
it	depends	on	the	country	and	the	business	sector	as	to	what	the	recovery	pattern	will	be
although	some	businesses	such	as	delivery	are	not	affected	lot
but	in	many	business	sectors	that	demand	has	decreased	the	chance	of	sudden	recovery	in	shape	shape	is	rare
but	whether	to	be	gradual	recovery	shape	or	not	depends	on	the	type	of	business	if	some	businesses	structure	the	demand	for	the	supply	and	consumer	behavior	has	changed	causing	demand	to	not	return	to	the	original	it	will	become	shape	which	is	not	coming	back	as	before	the	covid	period
how	did	covid	change	consumers
from	bcg	researching	and	surveying	consumer	behavior
survey	of	thai	consumers	in	the	past	month	found	that	what	people	spend	less	are	going	out	to	eat	going	to	the	movies	recreation
although	many	people	think	that	after	opening	the	city	people	will	return	to	spend	the	same	amount	bcg	points	out	that	most	consumers	have	become	satisfied	with	their	stay
become	less	demand	in	the	future
the	more	people	will	spend	such	as	the	delivery	of	food	with	the	information	that	in	april	some	fast	food	businesses	deliveries	increased	times	over	the	same	period	last	year
next	is	health	care	products
preventative	healthcare	because	people	are	more	health	conscious	and	want	to	prevent	illness	from	the	cow	virus
which	includes	vitamins	supplements	and	health	insurance	that	is	risk	prevention	tool	and	easier	to	buy	convenience	stores	or	applications
there	is	question	of	whether	consumer	behavior	will	change	permanently	like	flight	behavior	after	the	incident
in	the	perspective	of	khun	isada	some	behaviors	will	change	quite	permanently
such	as	ordering	food	online	delivery	which	previously	had	already
but	thailand	still	uses	less	compared	to	other	countries
the	emergence	of	covid	is	catalyst	catalyst	for	people	to	change	their	behavior	to	order	more	online
principles	for	entrepreneurs	to	seize	opportunities	in	times	of	crisis	khun	isada	spoke	about	the	changing	business	model	to	seize	the	opportunity	even	in	times	of	crisis
with	the	epidemic	situation	of	the	covid	virus	despite	causing	many	uncertainties	and	risks	to	the	business	sector	khun	issada	sees	that	there	are	opportunities	for	risk
adaptation	is	important	for	enabling	entrepreneurs	to	seize	opportunities	during	crisis

organizational	culture	is	not	just	what	people	inside	the	organization	can	see	but	what	outsiders	can	perceive	on	the	values	that	the	organization	treasures
those	who	are	ready	to	learn	come	first
let	us	take	look	at	techsauce	as	an	example
the	organization	does	not	give	privilege	to	genius	but	emphasizes	on	experience	sharing	to	allow	every	working	individual	to	learn	together
also	if	they	have	to	choose	between	an	expert	who	cannot	get	along	with	others	and	an	average	person	who	is	willing	to	learn	with	learning	mindset	the	latter	will	be	chosen
this	is	because	the	hunger	to	learn	will	make	them	ever	improving
dr	joshua	pas	corporate	innovation	director	and	managing	director	of	adventures	by	scg	used	to	say	that	to	choose	person	to	work	in	ones	organization	choose	from	their	attitude	and	passion	as	they	make	person	have	learning	mindset	and	always	ready	to	learn	new	things
share	the	knowledge	to	fellow	co	workers	not	only	should	talented	individuals	be	praised	for	doing	their	jobs	well	but	their	experience	and	achievement	will	also	be	emphasized	and	shared	as	case	study	for	the	rest	of	the	organization
because	one	of	the	crucial	factors	that	will	improve	the	organizations	in	this	era	is	to	have	space	for	knowledge	sharing	platform	for	people	in	the	organization	to	share	experiences	of	their	expertise	such	as	direct	experiences	or	information	obtained	from	attending	the	seminars	to	their	fellow	colleagues	the	importance	of	knowledge	sharing	is	not	just	about	what	we	have	learned	but	how	to	adapt	it	and	use	it	in	our	organization	nowadays	organizations	will	have	to	stress	on	creating	more	growth	mindset	and	project	based	learning
if	there	is	an	employee	wanting	to	resign	to	recruit	another	employee	to	replace	the	previous	person	would	cause	the	organization	time	and	resources	to	train	the	new	employee
in	this	case	the	organization	could	solve	this	problem	by	relocating	the	particular	employee	to	the	department	that	they	are	interested	in	or	come	up	with	special	project	for	them	to	try	working	in	new	field	as	well	as	starting	learning	activities	such	as	hackathon	to	develop	mindset	of	the	people	in	the	organization	share	knowledge	among	departments	as	well	as	develop	relationship	among	departments
open	communication	apart	from	sharing	knowledge	clear	and	effective	communication	is	another	important	factor	as	it	helps	people	in	the	organization	to	reflect	on	their	work	talking	about	difficulties	and	problems	that	they	face	as	well	as	giving	suggestions	and	advice	to	one	another
this	could	be	done	through	face	to	face	interaction	like	meeting	or	sometimes	open	communication	will	have	to	be	utilized	for	people	to	stay	anonymous	which	allows	them	to	give	their	honest	opinion	resulting	in	clear	and	effective	feedback
to	positively	get	along	with	the	organizational	culture	that	is	open	minded	encouraging	people	to	think	and	try	new	things	leaders	will	have	to	be	empathetic	not	just	sympathetic	with	their	underlings
one	on	one	meeting	could	be	organized	between	leaders	and	staff	under	them	and	it	does	not	have	to	necessarily	be	about	work	but	any	other	topics	like	well	being
if	there	is	chance	leaders	could	ask	whether	there	is	any	problem	making	the	staff	feel	that	their	leaders	can	be	relied	on
cultivating	culture	of	transparency	in	the	workplace	another	important	point	is	cultivating	culture	of	transparency	in	the	workplace
do	not	let	outsiders	be	more	influential	than	people	inside
for	example	if	there	is	rumor	that	an	employee	will	resign
instead	of	laying	them	off	or	avoiding	seeing	each	other	they	should	be	called	to	clarify	the	story
in	some	cases	stop	toxic	measures	might	have	to	be	used	to	solve	issues	in	the	organization
for	instance	the	organization	has	talented	worker	but	is	very	egoistic	and	causes	problems	for	others	while	working
if	the	organization	keeps	this	person	for	their	talent	there	might	be	negative	effect	on	the	whole	working	system
therefore	the	organization	has	to	sack	this	person	to	eliminate	the	potential	long	term	problem

how	can	customers	recall	your	brand	and	end	up	purchasing	your	products
why	do	we	enjoy	reading	an	extremely	long	story
how	can	we	tell	memorable	story
good	storytelling	can	change	the	alphabet	into	powerful	and	unforgettable	story
lets	experience	some	insights	from	professional	storytelling	dr	pat	dr	utain	boonorana	or	jaemor	content	creator	of	dr	tood	and	look	image	and	khun	pert	pongpiti	phasukyud	content	creator	of	ad	addict
why	storytelling	is	important	for	sme	khun	pert	started	with	an	interesting	question	how	many	ads	do	people	see	in	day	the	study	in	found	that	we	see	about	ads	daily
its	been	years	now	so	we	could	have	seen	double	which	could	be	ten	thousand	ads
thats	why	storytelling	matters	to	sme	so	sme	needs	to	find	ways	to	attract	consumers
good	approach	is	to	share	good	story	through	creative	communication	to	win	over	customers	hearts
most	people	tend	to	forget	what	they	say	and	what	they	do	but	not	how	they	feel
great	storytelling	is	key	to	help	brand	draw	their	attention	and	can	sit	in	their	hearts
dr	pat	asked	an	easy	question	how	many	medium	tone	consonants	are	in	thai
everyone	can	remember	and	nobody	memorizes	the	alphabets	because	the	story	is	easier	to	recall
the	research	found	that	we	learn	by	memory	and	record	it	as	story
that	means	we	should	communicate	with	the	story	not	factsheet	as	it	will	directly	penetrate	to	customers	brains	and	their	perception
many	sme	entrepreneurs	might	have	heard	that	storytelling	leads	to	customer	purchase	and	business	growth
in	fact	dr	pat	said	theres	no	storytelling	like	that
the	best	thing	about	storytelling	is	to	penetrate	to	customer	memory	and	memory	will	turn	to	compelling	power
another	example	when	we	ask	people	to	share	fairy	tale	little	red	riding	hood
can	anyone	do	that
most	people	can	tell	that	story	even	though	cant	remember	when	they	first	heard	it
its	like	remembering	medium	tone	consonants	as	story	will	become	an	experience
if	people	recall	us	but	dont	buy	our	products	they	will	buy	them	in	the	future
anyway	when	they	cant	recall	us	while	they	want	to	buy	something	that	means	we	are	not	their	choice
therefore	the	role	of	storytelling	is	to	attract	people	and	make	them	know	us	and	memory	will	finally	do	its	job
dr	pat	raised	few	examples	about	advertising
an	mba	course	in	university
this	ad	shows	womans	hand	with	mans	hand	wearing	ring	to	her	finger	and	presents	copy	mba	gives	you	more	than	you	expected
much	has	been	said	that	if	you	want	girlfriend	or	boyfriend	join	an	mba
thats	why	this	story	is	adapted	to	create	an	ad
selling	by	story	helps	present	an	experience	that	anyone	can	have	and	we	do	that	by	applying	real	insight	for	creating	story
khun	pert	elaborated	that	we	create	story	to	release	its	content	into	peoples	minds	so	that	they	can	feel	emotionally	engaged	and	remember	us
the	key	is	an	insight	that	many	people	misunderstand	that	its	pain	point	behavior	or	solution
in	fact	they	re	something	beyond	that
for	example	acne	products
we	tend	to	perceive	that	an	insight	of	those	who	have	acne	problems	is	unconfidence
however	khun	pert	pointed	out	the	reason	theyre	not	confident	because	they	want	to	do	something	next
if	the	acne	disappeared	they	could	post	nice	look	on	instagram	and	then	they	may	gain	likes	from	their	friends	or	someone	would	have	crush	on	them	just	like	the	ad	that	reflects	something	deep	down	peoples	mind	to	present	to	target	customers
if	you	use	your	products	or	services	as	solution	instead	of	mentioning	only	the	acne	performance	you	can	hit	the	target	then
easy	ways	to	search	for	insight	people	who	heard	about	that	ice	cream	started	wondering	if	theres	story	behind	that	peculiar	name
the	staff	told	us	that	the	founder	wanted	to	make	the	same	flavor	as	he	had	at	boston
he	mixed	milk	and	cream	as	base	recipe	with	trial	and	error
the	taste	is	close	to	the	original	on	his	th	trial	and	that	is	the	history	of	dont	give	up
people	who	have	that	ice	cream	can	feel	some	experience
this	is	an	example	that	khun	pert	realizes	that	smes	shouldnt	start	with	film	advertising	because	advertising	nowadays	doesnt	always	limit	to	film
youd	better	start	with	your	brand	or	products	and	the	message	and	products	must	be	well	matched
your	products	must	be	high	quality	and	in	line	with	their	messages	otherwise	youll	get	the	negative	impact	of	deceiving	customers
khun	pert	notices	that	many	smes	have	faced	challenges	when	creating	storytelling	for	their	products	as	products	are	not	self	manufactured	but	ordered	from	others	and	then	placed	brand	stickers	on	them
when	you	order	products	from	oem	original	equipment	manufacturer	how	can	you	tell	the	story
would	you	tell	your	story
some	people	were	laid	off	or	wanted	to	run	business	to	get	rich	so	they	dont	have	any	story	to	share
khun	pert	recommended	another	issues	that	can	be	your	source	of	storytelling
new	trends	in	storytelling	the	art	of	storytelling	storytelling	consists	of	types	of	rhythm
insight	and	create	an	experience	for	them	honestly
apart	from	telling	product	benefits	smes	can	express	their	belief	in	something	and	their	attitude	towards	society
also	study	peoples	behavior	to	consider	which	part	of	your	story	fits	them	and	in	timely	manner
present	information	related	to	us
high	quality	product	is	base	and	reflects	good	storytelling
theres	no	fixed	rule	for	marketing	and	communication
take	an	action	by	yourself	to	get	lessons	learned	until	you	discover	your	own	formula
source	the	power	of	storytelling	in	business	seminar	topic	in	digital	sme	conference	thailand	september	professional	and	comprehensive	business	management	solution
for	sme
managing	costs	is	an	important	factor	in	determining	the	fate	of	business
in	the	restaurant	business	fresh	ingredients	make	up	the	majority	of	restaurant	inventory
how	well	those	are	managed	is	therefore	critical	to	restaurants	success
cutting	costs	without	compromising	the	quality	of	food	and	services	is	not	an	easy	task
surawech	telan	the	owner	of	mo	mo	paradise	shared	with	us	his	business	strategies	to	effectively	reduce	cost	and	manage	cash	flow	for	the	survival	of	restaurant	business	in	times	of	crisis
the	birth	of	mo	mo	paradise	in	thailand	over	ten	years	ago	discovered	authentic	japanese	style	shabu	when	visiting	japan	and	loved	it
mo	mo	paradise	has	an	interesting	business	model	in	terms	of	offering	premium	quality	delicious	food	and	good	service	all	while	charging	reasonable	prices
saw	it	as	good	opportunity	to	promote	this	kind	of	restaurant	to	thais	who	like	japanese	shabu
so	contacted	the	owners	and	bought	license	to	open	mo	mo	paradise	in	thailand
currently	mo	mo	paradise	operates	twenty	branches	most	of	which	are	in	shopping	centers
currently	they	are	being	hit	hard	by	covid	and	have	had	to	make	lot	of	adjustments	how	difficult	is	it	to	deal	with	the	covid	crisis
daily	sales	dropped	to	only	of	what	they	should	be
our	employees	have	been	cut	back	to	the	difficult	part	of	the	restaurant	business	especially	buffet	restaurant	like	mo	mo	paradise	is	that	we	must	store	lot	of	fresh	ingredients
each	lockdown	has	had	huge	impacts	but	even	before	the	lockdowns	began	always	calculated	the	right	supply	of	raw	materials	for	our	build	to	order	business	to	minimize	waste
our	working	team	must	consider	various	factors	such	as	seasonal	trends	to	match	daily	traffic	model
think	the	important	thing	is	that	we	pay	attention	to	data	collection	and	every	single	raw	material	not	just	the	main	ingredients
sometimes	secondary	supplies	of	raw	materials	can	make	you	lose	more	money
cost	control	is	not	entirely	about	skus	but	we	need	to	pay	attention	to	every	detail	in	terms	of	rent	owners	of	commercial	areas	have	been	very	supportive
however	we	do	what	we	can	to	control	our	own	costs	which	mo	mo	paradise	does	quite	well
we	still	have	sufficient	retained	earnings	to	continue	our	business
in	this	fragile	situation	each	business	may	have	different	degrees	of	tolerance
the	most	important	thing	is	to	minimize	our	costs	in	order	to	keep	the	company	running	until	the	situation	returns	to	normal	an	important	problem	when	buffets	turn	to	deliveries
personally	believe	that	the	dining	experience	is	the	most	important	thing	for	restaurant
dont	think	that	delivery	provides	as	complete	an	experience	as	dining	in	the	restaurant	so	we	only	offered	certain	menus	for	delivery
but	this	year	we	faced	difficult	problem	with	restaurants	in	shopping	malls	being	closed
all	our	mo	mo	paradise	branches	are	in	shopping	malls	so	our	sales	turned	to	zero
our	team	solved	this	problem	by	launching	new	momo	paradise	beside	you	campaign	aiming	for	nationwide	delivery
we	carried	out	trial	deliveries	in	bangkok	vicinities	and	upcountry	provinces
we	had	to	find	way	to	ensure	that	customers	received	their	meals	in	the	most	perfect	condition	just	like	dining	at	the	restaurant
our	team	was	immediately	called	in	to	discuss	this	and	decided	that	if	we	had	to	do	delivery	it	must	be	the	best	possible	so	that	customers	can	enjoy	an	experience	as	close	to	dining	in	restaurant	as	possible
we	have	had	to	come	up	with	new	packaging	material	equipment	and	temperature	solutions	before	sending	food	to	delivery	riders	so	that	it	can	reach	customers	in	perfect	condition
this	has	worked	out	so	well	that	we	plan	to	continue	food	delivery	even	after	our	restaurants	re	open	the	difficult	part	of	reducing	costs	while	maintaining	the	same	quality	in	my	opinion	effective	cost	profit	management	is	how	we	control	our	business
it	not	about	pushing	the	burden	onto	customers	by	raising	prices
we	can	cut	costs	without	compromising	product	quality
everything	must	be	of	the	same	or	better	quality
mo	mo	paradise	therefore	focuses	on	cost	control
the	first	thing	that	needs	to	be	done	in	leaning	costs	is	communication	with	employees
held	meeting	with	all	our	branch	managers	encouraging	them	to	work	together	to	achieve	our	cost	cutting	goals
had	to	learn	about	ways	to	control	costs	from	many	sources	as	best	as	could	so	that	customers	can	continue	to	receive	the	best	products	at	the	right	price
good	example	of	how	we	cut	costs	is	by	reducing	wastage	of	fresh	vegetables	starting	in	if	vegetables	arent	fresh	our	customers	will	notice	it
we	cant	serve	food	like	that	to	customers	so	there	was	quite	lot	of	waste	when	vegetables	went	bad
the	first	thing	to	do	was	to	seriously	collect	information	on	current	losses	and	set	goals	for	improvement
data	collection	must	be	carried	out	accurately	to	ensure	that	we	tackle	the	right	spots
for	our	fresh	vegetable	problem	we	collected	data	in	two	dimensions	what	were	the	vegetables	with	the	highest	wastage	and	what	was	the	highest	cost	vegetable	wastage
for	example	we	discovered	that	although	japanese	negi	ranked	fourth	in	terms	of	wastage	after	purple	cabbage	baby	corn	and	lettuce	it	had	the	highest	cost
we	found	out	more	about	what	caused	the	loss	and	come	up	with	an	analysis	phase	summary	to	find	the	cause	tools	and	methods	for	solving	problems	such	as	revising	our	standard	operation	procedures	sop	to	outline	more	details	such	as	training	new	employees	to	cut	vegetables	correctly	the	quality	of	vegetables	and	sizes
we	also	discussed	our	problems	with	suppliers
finally	we	looked	into	proper	storage	locations	and	temperatures	for	each	vegetable
we	had	to	re	arrange	our	refrigerators	put	vegetables	that	need	to	be	kept	at	very	cold	temperature	on	top	closest	to	the	chiller	and	those	that	can	be	stored	at	higher	temperatures	in	the	lower	decks	including	fifo	first	in	first	out	to	make	our	supplies	circulate	better
based	on	three	months	of	data	we	found	that	the	average	wastage	cost	was	at	so	we	aimed	to	lower	it	to	and	eventually	to	only
how	to	deal	with	cash	flow	during	crisis
we	are	experiencing	difficult	time
however	despite	that	mo	mo	paradise	has	been	able	to	maintain	balanced	cash	flow
in	normal	times	we	had	to	manage	our	cash	flow	account	so	that	more	money	came	in	than	went	out
any	remaining	cash	was	kept	as	reserve
we	need	to	control	expenses	either	in	good	or	bad	times	and	not	just	look	at	profit	and	loss
business	needs	working	capital	for	daily	operations
how	should	the	restaurant	business	adapt
what	we	are	going	through	will	be	good	for	our	future
if	business	has	strong	reserves	some	of	that	should	be	invested	in	sustainable	growth	to	keep	the	business	running
in	our	case	that	meant	doing	things	such	as	delivering	mo	mo	paradise	meals	across	the	country
as	for	our	future	plans	im	considering	cloud	kitchens	but	it	takes	time	to	plan	and	set	up	that	kind	of	system
cloud	kitchens	have	the	advantage	of	lower	costs	with	cheaper	rent	and	fewer	employees	usually	only	people	compared	to	normal	branch	with	people
however	physical	restaurants	are	still	important	because	when	the	situation	returns	to	normal	people	will	want	to	come	back	to	enjoy	the	restaurant	experience

cambodia	is	neighboring	market	with	many	attractive	features
its	border	is	close	to	thailand	so	commuting	back	and	forth	is	convenient
also	the	consumer	market	in	cambodia	is	not	fully	grown	and	the	competition	is	not	relatively	high	at	the	moment
scb	has	opened	branches	in	cambodia	to	provide	extensive	services	to	customers	in	several	special	economic	zones	such	as	phnom	penh	battambang	siem	reap	and	sihanoukville
cambodia	is	neighboring	market	with	many	attractive	features
its	border	is	close	to	thailand	so	commuting	back	and	forth	is	convenient
also	the	consumer	market	in	cambodia	is	not	fully	grown	and	the	competition	is	not	relatively	high	at	the	moment
scb	has	opened	branches	in	cambodia	to	provide	extensive	services	to	customers	in	several	special	economic	zones	such	as	phnom	penh	battambang	siem	reap	and	sihanoukville
here	are	steps	to	know	before	starting	business	in	cambodia
observe	customers	and	find	an	opportunity	dated	back	to	years	ago	khun	sombat	was	distributor	of	kubota	an	agricultural	machinery	brand	in	surin	province	where	the	area	is	close	to	chong	chom	border	cambodia
as	over	of	local	thai	people	over	there	can	speak	the	cambodian	language	cambodians	regularly	travel	to	buy	consumer	goods	in	surin	and	also	agricultural	machinery	items	at	khun	sombats	store
from	his	observation	and	talk	to	cambodian	customers	his	products	are	in	high	demand	and	he	anticipated	good	opportunity	to	penetrate	his	business	in	cambodia	as	the	market	is	still	open	and	less	competitive	comparing	with	business	expansion	in	thailand
make	field	trip	to	prove	it	with	your	own	eyes	when	coming	up	with	an	idea	to	run	business	in	cambodia	khun	sombatwent	out	to	explore	the	agricultural	field	to	see	it	personally	to	gain	real	market	insights
traveled	to	cambodia	through	aranyaprathet	border	and	hired	travel	van	for	days	to	survey	around	tonle	sap	lake	the	largest	freshwater	lake	in	southeast	asia	to	check	how	big	is	the	agricultural	area	is	most	area	plain	or	slope
how	do	people	do	agricultural	works
is	there	any	agricultural	machinery	store
at	that	time	cambodian	agriculturists	mostly	used	animal	labor	and	there	were	few	machinery	stores	near	the	border
after	that	khun	sombat	made	market	trial	by	increasing	product	orders	to	sell	to	cambodian	customers	and	his	business	was	going	well
year	later	he	signed	contract	with	siam	kubota	corporation	co	ltd	as	an	agent	to	sell	kubota	machinery	in	cambodia
find	dealers	and	partners	when	khun	sombat	firstly	launched	kubota	products	in	cambodia	he	delivered	products	through	cambodian	distributors
at	that	time	he	had	to	compete	with	chinese	machinery	which	is	cheaper	than	kubota	made	in	japan
he	coordinated	with	siam	kubota	to	set	marketing	strategic	plan	khun	sombat	took	charged	of	dealers	and	product	promotions	while	siam	kubota	was	responsible	for	after	sales	service
most	thai	is	quite	worried	about	running	business	in	cambodia	and	they	are	very	careful	on	that
anyway	the	key	is	to	select	the	right	person	to	be	your	partner	no	matter	which	country	you	will	go
my	success	in	cambodia	starts	with	selecting	dealers	or	partners	who	really	have	business	passion	with	strong	marketing	intention	and	are	ready	to	grow	with	us	in	the	long	term	said	khun	sombat
at	the	first	stage	of	marketing	in	addition	to	product	dealers	khun	sombat	shared	his	business	experience	in	thailand	and	helpful	suggestions	with	his	partners	such	as	selecting	showroom	location	installment	sales	methods	creating	reliable	quality	and	after	sales	service	and	encouraging	customers	to	pay	slightly	higher	price	for	better	value
those	are	all	concerns	that	we	need	to	understand	with	local	partners	and	adjust	consumer	behavior	because	cambodians	didnt	know	anything	about	warranty	over	the	last	years	ago
trading	at	that	time	was	made	by	cash	verified	products	and	closed	sales	without	product	guarantee
therefore	we	need	to	educate	both	partners	and	customers	all	about	those	matters
after	years	of	running	the	kubota	business	khun	sombat	saw	growth	opportunities	in	the	automobile	market	in	cambodia	so	he	exported	mitsubishi	cars	to	be	launched	there
when	considering	the	cambodian	population	and	the	country	space	if	its	economic	growth	was	as	much	as	the	thai	market	the	size	of	the	cambodian	market	would	be	around	of	thailand	depending	on	the	type	of	business
mitsu	cambodia	co	ltd	currently	has	showrooms	in	phnom	penh	siem	reap	and	battambang
cambodian	consumers	tend	to	buy	high	priced	items	at	phnom	penh	more	than	upcountry
to	provide	extensive	after	sales	service	for	customers	we	opened	new	branches	in	the	provincial	area	and	plan	to	expand	two	more	branches	in	phnom	penh	very	soon
besides	we	also	plan	to	develop	showrooms	according	to	headquarters	rebranding	policy	to	create	mitsubishi	more	modern	brand
customer	needs	come	first	the	heart	of	achieving	business	success	in	khun	sombats	experience	is	customer	first
how	to	make	customers	buy	your	products	and	to	feel	good	value	for	money	satisfy	with	our	products	and	services
we	realize	that	customer	needs	are	essential
suppose	that	we	are	customers	ask	ourselves	what	do	we	need	from	the	salesperson	and	what	is	our	expectation	so	that	we	will	respond	to	them	based	on	the	principle	that	customer	needs	are	also	our	needs
most	significantly	we	must	be	honest	to	customers	in	order	to	keep	their	loyalty	sustainably
tips	for	clmv	market	penetration	khun	sombat	revealed	that	the	challenge	of	running	business	overseas	is	to	make	proper	investment
the	business	practices	in	each	country	differ	from	thailand	such	as	law	tax	import	and	export	process	transportation	document	registration	including	culture	and	tradition
those	who	are	interested	in	doing	business	in	that	country	will	have	to	study	all	those	aspects	so	the	marketing	will	run	easily	well
fortunately	scb	has	local	branches	in	the	country	that	khun	sombat	wants	to	invest	which	is	the	cambodian	commercial	bank	ccb	the	scb	affiliate
at	present	there	are	branches	in	special	economic	zones	phnom	penh	battambang	siem	reap	and	sihanoukville	that	facilitate	customers	with	loans	and	several	services
scb	will	support	customers	from	day	one	after	they	are	qualified	for	starting	the	business	in	cambodia
khun	sombat	has	summarized	principles	for	those	who	want	to	set	up	business	abroad	which	are	find	local	partner	if	you	dont	know	anything	about	that	market
good	business	partner	will	enhance	the	success	of	your	business
if	we	dont	have	business	partner	we	must	understand	the	market	be	familiar	with	the	area	know	what	that	market	needs	and	realize	if	that	market	is	competitive
if	that	market	is	competitive	its	worth	expanding	your	business	as	you	can	launch	products	in	new	market	while	the	competition	in	thailand	is	remaining	aggressive
its	also	good	opportunity	for	thai	entrepreneurs	to	bring	their	business	to	succeed	in	foreign	markets

how	can	we	build	strong	brand	and	win	the	hearts	of	customers	in	the	time	of	the	covid	crisis	that	has	changed	people	lifestyles	to	the	so	called	new	normal
always	have	the	same	questions	how	will	we	create	sales	when	we	must	close	the	shop	and	sell	online	instead
should	we	jump	to	sell	on	every	platform
the	fact	that	we	can	pursue	new	trends	suddenly	that	good	thing
but	you	must	understand	that	the	basics	of	branding	must	be	calm
because	building	brand	is	like	collecting	merit
in	this	article	we	will	learn	techniques	for	building	brand	to	win	the	hearts	of	customers	in	the	new	normal	era	with	asst
prof	dr	kritinee	phongthanalert	owner	of	marumura	page	or	ajarn	ged	good	strong	brand	is	brand	that	consumers	still	think	about	or	miss	you	all	the	time
dr	kritinee	gave	an	example	of	uniqlo	in	japan	that	even	during	the	covid	why	sales	are	still	increasing	even	though	many	stores	must	close
uniqlo	has	always	been	able	to	make	people	remember	by	offering	high	quality	comfortable	and	affordable	clothing
when	it	comes	to	covid	what	uniqlo	does	is	penetrate	the	stay	at	home	market
the	uniqlo	at	home	collection	has	been	released
make	the	shop	like	home	with	images	of	clothes	that	look	comfortable	when	staying	at	home	because	most	people	work	from	home
how	to	make	people	at	home	more	fun	and	comfortable
dr	kritinee	has	said	before	building	brand	is	like	accumulating	more	and	more	merit
for	example	uniqlo	has	good	products
already	have	quality
so	it	easier	to	succeed	because	customers	believe	in	the	quality	of	the	product	and	have	liking	for	the	brand	already
have	clear	distinction	brand	owners	must	answer	what	the	strengths	of	the	brand	are
how	is	it	different	from	other	brands
the	best	marketing	is	marketing	without	marketing
for	example	our	own	thai	bread	brand	called	green	wondery
what	this	brand	does	is	create	unique	product
by	dyeing	the	bread	in	very	beautiful	gradation	of	indigo	that	it	can	be	called	piece	of	art
until	making	people	buy	even	though	there	is	very	little	marketing	just	post	picture	of	bread	on	facebook	there	are	many	people	ordering	because	the	bread	is	beautiful	it	worth	taking	pictures	to	show	off	online
and	another	strong	point	is	that	it	is	difficult	for	others	to	imitate	because	the	technique	is	very	difficult
another	interesting	example	is	nang	salad	rolls
their	salad	rolls	have	unique	way	of	making	products
there	are	different	logos	beautiful	salads	beautifully	arranged	on	plate
the	sauce	container	is	well	designed	just	squeeze	the	lid	and	you	can	eat	without	spilling	which	shows	attention	to	detail
the	powder	sheet	has	thin	color
take	beautiful	photos	which	are	compatible	with	the	lifestyle	of	people	who	work	from	home	who	want	to	add	some	color	to	their	lives
but	besides	our	brand	having	strengths	and	differences	it	not	enough	but	also	interesting
must	answer	whether	the	difference	is	interested	in	the	customer	or	not
which	can	be	easily	tested	for	example	take	picture	of	the	product	and	post	it	on	facebook	to	see	if	there	are	excited	or	not
but	over	time	people	have	imitated	our	products	until	there	is	no	difference	then	what	to	do
dr	kritinee	gave	an	example	of	choya	which	is	japan	number	plum	wine	brand
which	when	done	others	imitate	thus	pulling	out	the	original
created	cafe	called	choya	caf	to	make	people	remember	it	as	japan	number	one	plum	wine
he	also	thought	about	how	to	attract	teenagers	because	plum	wine	looks	outdated
therefore	the	shop	is	designed	to	look	minimal	with	warmth	like	drinking	at	home	bright	and	looks	comfortable
the	brand	wants	to	communicate	the	power	of	plum	wine	as	being	chic	by	using	clear	plastic	glass	to	see	the	big	plums
there	are	different	types	of	plum	juice
even	plum	juice	with	ice	cream	plum	shaved	ice	which	came	out	beautiful	and	interesting	making	teenagers	want	to	take	pictures	and	show	them	on	social	media
it	also	allows	customers	to	make	their	own	style	of	plum	wine
you	can	choose	sugar	choose	your	own	plum	choose	jar
when	there	is	workshop	on	pickling	plum	wine	teenagers	take	videos	and	post	them	on	social	media
create	memory	that	choya	is	the	pinnacle	of	the	plum	wine	brand
but	if	our	products	are	the	same	as	others	what	should	we	do
for	example	if	we	receive	products	from	other	people	to	sell
dr	kritinee	suggested	that	you	try	to	look	at	the	service	if	we	can	make	it	different	from	others
for	example	nojima	is	japanese	electronics	store
which	is	fed	up	with	the	price	war	strategy	because	it	is	considered	unsustainable
nojima	therefore	changed	the	internal	system
calling	salesperson	consultant	is	consultant	not	just	salesperson
the	products	are	the	same	as	other	stores	but	they	make	difference	in	service
when	customer	asks	for	product	the	consultant	will	not	just	take	the	customer	to	that	product
but	first	ask	the	customer	what	needs	they	have
for	example	some	people	want	vacuum	cleaner	that	needs	silence	to	not	disturb	small	children	while	sleeping
because	the	needs	of	each	customer	are	different
consultants	will	ask	for	details	to	be	able	to	recommend	the	most	suitable	product
will	listen	to	customers	first	to	clearly	see	their	needs
information	from	customers	will	enable	them	to	choose	what	is	most	suitable	and	cost	effective	for	customers
but	to	be	able	to	provide	this	kind	of	service	employees	must	deeply	understand	the	product	features
understand	and	find	the	best	solutions	for	customers	including	thinking	for	customers	as	well
customers	are	impressed	and	decide	to	buy	even	though	the	price	is	not	cheaper	than	other	stores
this	can	be	applied	to	selling	products	online	by	chatting	with	customers	to	find	customer	needs	and	recommend	suitable	products	as	well
clear	brand	identity	brand	people	is	the	creation	of	one	person
branding	is	more	than	just	putting	logo	on	the	packaging
the	brand	is	more	than	that
create	clear	brand	identity	that	people	will	remember
brand	origin	happened	years	ago	the	first	brand	to	be	made	was	louis	vuitton	which	originally	started	from	making	luggage
but	people	don	remember	so	put	logo	on	it	for	customers	to	remember
every	brand	wants	customers	to	say	that	they	want	our	brand
but	what	causes	customers	to	remember	one	brand	more	than	another
how	do	we	keep	our	brand	in	the	head	of	our	customers
one	way	is	to	tell	the	story	of	every	product	properties	in	the	same	direction	with	mellow	easy	to	remember
not	wanting	to	say	anything	just	say	it	without	connection
start	by	selecting	certain	brand	features	that	are	associated	with	them	and	then	linking	them	to	the	logo
the	name	of	the	brand	is	the	logo
the	brand	outfit	is	the	packaging
and	most	importantly	don	forget	what	our	stance	is
what	do	we	intend	to	do	on	the	first	day	of	starting	the	business
our	brand	is	identity	is	to	set	up	one	person	and	must	be	clearly	defined	as	guideline
so	everyone	on	the	team	can	communicate	the	same
everyone	must	see	the	same	image
when	the	identity	is	clear	then	take	it	to	design	and	must	have	brand	book
employees	do	not	communicate	as	employees	themselves	must	communicate	as	brand
an	important	element	of	brand	identities	is	personality	is	your	own	brand	and	must	be	clearly	communicated
language	used	in	all	communication	channels
what	we	believe	wish	to	do	the	more	we	tell	our	beliefs	the	more	people	are	attached	to	and	see	the	brand
don	follow	the	trend	or	do	things	that	we	are	not	good	at
let	do	what	interests	us
the	more	we	get	into	something	make	it	easier	is	to	market
relationships	numbers	you	must	check	how	the	relationship	between	you	and	our	customers	is
use	good	relationships	to	be	useful	in	times	of	crisis
how	to	gradually	create	merit	for	customers	and	impress	us	more	and	more
for	example	an	employee	noticed	that	grandmother	who	regularly	dines	in	hasn	been	to	the	restaurant	for	long	time
he	was	surprised	until	he	went	to	see	her	at	home
it	turned	out	that	grandma	was	lying	unconscious	in	the	house
this	made	it	possible	to	save	grandma	life	in	time
daily	attention	will	build	good	relationships	with	customers
crisis	is	time	when	everyone	needs	positive	energy
want	to	feel	good	brands	that	communicate	positive	energy	will	be	remembered	by	our	customers
take	the	opportunity	during	the	new	normal	to	deliver	something	that	can	resonate	with	customers
dr	kritinee	gave	an	example	of	french	restaurant	in	tokyo	that	had	to	close	because	of	the	coronavirus
what	the	restaurant	did	is	communicate	on	twitter	always	telling	customers	recipes
after	lot	of	customers	retweeted	he	decides	to	sell	sandwiches	as	delivery
people	started	to	support	it	because	they	felt	that	the	restaurant	gave	lot	of	free	recipes
after	that	he	started	making	well	organized	delivery	lunch	box	like	eating	at	restaurant	called	morning	dinner	set
make	good	food	that	will	increase	people	energy	in	the	morning
another	example	of	building	good	relationships	with	customers	during	crisis	is	hostel	called	kumano
it	was	also	heavily	impacted	by	covid
but	with	creativity	the	service	has	been	upgraded	to	online	stay	for	yen	by	doing	it	through	the	zoom	system
customers	who	come	to	buy	online	stay	in	zoom	room	must	tell	their	nickname	and	hometown
the	owner	creates	realistic	experience	that	is	taking	walking	tour	from	the	front	of	the	train	station	until	arriving	at	the	hotel	and	checking	in
in	addition	it	also	takes	customers	to	various	attractions	using	google	maps	for	everyone	to	see	photos
in	addition	guests	must	prepare	photos	that	show	the	highlights	of	each	person	hometown
when	it	time	to	check	out	it	will	show	vdo	that	says	that	the	hostel	really	wants	everyone	to	come	here
this	makes	it	full	of	bookings	every	day
dr	kritinee	emphasized	that	during	the	crisis	do	not	think	too	much	about	profit
it	good	to	just	be	still	alive
but	use	this	time	to	accumulate	merit	by	building	good	relationship	with	customers
find	the	real	value	ask	yourself	what	the	value	of	our	products	and	services	is
what	exactly	is	the	customer	buying	the	product	or	really	is	some	experience
there	is	japanese	brand	called	snow	peak	selling	camping	products
but	he	doesn	look	at	him	selling	trekking	gear
but	he	sells	the	experience	of	being	in	touch	with	nature
because	customers	want	to	experience	nature	so	he	thought	about	whether	he	could	really	help	his	customers	to	experience	nature	more	easily
therefore	campaign	has	been	made	for	customers	to	try	making	campfires	at	branches	try	sleeping	in	tent	grilling	food	like	forest	grill
city	people	may	start	to	open	to	more	exposure	to	nature
there	is	also	snow	peak	caf	simulating	culinary	experience	in	the	forest
making	coffee	drips	in	the	forest	allows	the	city	people	to	experience
there	is	also	camping	office	decoration	service	or	outdoor	meetings	like	camping
the	idea	behind	this	is	to	bring	people	closer	to	nature
including	collaborating	with	condominiums	to	create	camping	atmosphere
it	also	helps	cities	where	there	are	only	elderly	people	who	do	not	travel	and	promotes	that	going	to	those	cities	is	journey	to	get	closer	to	nature	which	is	another	way	to	help	the	locals
upon	discovering	that	the	true	value	of	brand	is	in	bringing	nature	into	people	lives	it	has	become	an	interesting	business	model	that	is	more	than	just	selling	camping	gear
each	activity	was	encouraged	by	one	another
you	must	ask	yourself	if	sometimes	the	product	may	change	but	still	meet	the	value	that	we	set	or	not
if	we	find	true	value	we	must	maintain	it
but	if	you	haven	found	the	value	extract	the	essence	to	see	the	value	first
don	just	stick	with	the	product
in	summary	what	is	good	brand
this	question	can	be	used	as	an	indicator	do	customers	think	of	us	easily
do	customers	want	to	talk	about	us
do	customers	support	us	regularly	and	do	customers	want	to	recommend	us	to	others
if	the	answer	is	yes	then	we	have	taken	the	brand	in	the	right	direction
but	if	not	then	go	back	and	improve	according	to	all	techniques
and	most	importantly	don	forget	that	building	brand	is	like	collecting	merit
there	are	both	good	products	that	meet	what	customers	want
and	in	times	of	crisis	building	good	relationships	putting	positive	energy	on	customers	will	make	customers	remember	and	love	our	brand	source	of	the	project	the	dots	digital	commercex	by	asst

the	world	leading	organizations	including	apple	google	samsung	and	ibm	use	design	thinking	to	drive	innovation	and	deliver	customer	facing	outcomes	that	lead	to	organizational	success
the	design	thinking	emphasizes	the	importance	of	people	or	customer	centric
it	is	process	that	attempts	to	understand	customer	needs	by	making	assumptions	identifying	problems	developing	ideas	which	has	main	steps	empathize	define	ideate	prototype	and	test
organizations	are	interested	in	applying	the	principles	of	design	thinking	to	create	new	innovations	that	meets	the	needs	of	customers
of	course	design	thinking	is	beneficial	to	the	organization
but	what	many	organizations	may	not	yet	think	or	plan	is	how	to	bring	design	thinking	into	the	organization	to	allow	people	in	the	organization	to	accept	and	use	this	work	process	for	maximum	benefit
today	we	have	techniques	for	applying	design	thinking	to	be	used	in	organizations	to	achieve	success	as	follows	start	from	small	part	design	thinking	is	not	something	that	can	instantly	change	an	entire	organization	overnight
because	it	is	something	that	must	gradually	let	employees	adjust	their	concepts	and	begin	to	gradually	practice	all	processes
so	we	should	start	with	small	group	or	project	first
otherwise	start	with	team	or	group	of	employees	tweaking	the	idea	and	trying	it	out	by	working	on	small	project	as	an	experiment	use	design	thinking	techniques	to	apply	and	then	gradually	expanding	the	circle	wider
assign	those	who	will	learn	first	and	those	who	will	teach	and	motivate	the	rest	of	the	staff	to	bring	new	concepts	or	ways	of	working	into	use	in	the	organization
there	is	always	group	of	people	who	accept	new	things	and	apply	quickly
it	may	be	someone	who	has	previous	knowledge	or	experience	or	someone	who	is	ready	to	learn	new	things	to	make	these	first	groups	spread	knowledge	and	motivate	others	to	create	network	of	learning	and	knowledge	spreading
or	creating	champions	of	each	division	that	drive	and	teach	others	on	the	team	to	accept	and	apply
avoid	working	in	silos	between	teams	and	departments
design	thinking	is	the	use	of	cross	functional	knowledge	and	the	collaboration	of	many	departments
this	is	most	helpful	if	brainstorming	is	done	also	sharing	ideas	from	people	who	have	experience	with	ideas	then	various	perspectives	come	together
therefore	if	there	is	practice	or	trial	project	there	should	be	people	from	different	teams	working	together
understand	that	design	thinking	is	dynamic	process	that	is	not	tied	to	chain	of	command
in	the	work	process	each	step	is	not	required	to	follow	chain	of	command
and	there	is	no	need	to	follow	each	step
it	able	to	skip	steps	and	come	back	again
no	need	to	start	with	empathize	define	ideate	prototype	and	test
follow	this	for	every	problem	and	be	able	to	jump	oversteps	according	to	the	nature	of	each	problem
state	clearly	how	success	will	be	measured
how	will	the	organization	communicate	and	identify	the	success	measures	of	the	design	thinking	implementation
there	must	be	system	to	measure	progress	on	the	job
are	there	any	projects	that	use	design	thinking	in	their	work	or	measuring	employee	satisfaction	towards	applying	design	thinking	in	their	work
design	thinking	like	bringing	anything	new	into	an	organization	takes	time	to	truly	be	absorbed	and	understood	and	implemented	across	the	organization
the	organization	must	find	way	to	communicate	motivate	employees	to	understand	the	benefits	and	implement	it	naturally	and	effectively	although	it	takes	time	and	effort	if	done	correctly	it	will	bring	good	results	and	create	satisfaction	and	truly	meet	the	needs	of	customers

in	crisis	situation	that	everyone	needs	to	keep	at	home	searching	for	information	on	stores	especially	restaurants	that	deliver	food	to	your	home	therefore	mainly	use	the	internet	with	search	in	google	search	or	google	map	making	online	advertising	to	announce	to	the	world	that	our	store	is	open	here	is	as	important	as	quality	products	and	good	services	because	if	something	is	good	but	people	don	know	that	there	is	it	can	be	sold
but	for	sme	business	owners	when	buying	full	fledged	online	ad	for	tens	of	thousands	of	baht	it	may	not	be	worth	it
google	my	business	is	free	service	that	does	not	meet	the	sme	needs	and	these	are	the	benefits	that	businesses
sme	can	be	obtained	from	pinning	stores	open	up	business	opportunities	by	building	your	business	identity	online	with	the	behavior	of	today	consumers	that	prefer	searching	for	information	before	making	purchase	in	which	of	thais	surveyed	the	data	via	google
creating	business	identity	online	with	google	my	business	tools	such	as	google	search	and	google	map	is	launch	for	tens	of	millions	of	thais	who	access	the	internet
get	to	know	our	business	and	from	the	trend	of	using	search	terms	near	me	such	as	restaurants	near	me	cafes	near	me	etc
increasingly	is	an	opportunity	for	our	store	to	appear	on	the	mobile	phone	screen	of	the	customer	it	is	an	effective	way	to	advertise	your	business	without	the	small	business	expenses	that	you	don	overlook
no	matter	how	far	the	distance	the	business	can	be	done	in	an	era	of	booming	delivery	service	and	transferring	money	through	mobile	apps	it	never	been	easier
distance	is	therefore	not	an	obstacle	to	sales
especially	in	situations	where	people	do	not	leave	the	house	restaurant	businesses	to	have	to	sell	primarily	with	delivery
pinning	google	my	business	creates	an	online	store	identity	for	customers	to	search	for	our	store
no	matter	how	far	away	customers	are	ready	to	call	to	order	our	food	delivered	to	home
and	more	importantly	with	the	number	statistics	google	my	business	has	collected	business	owners	can	see	that	customers	positive	reviews	make	sales	even	better
in	the	offline	world	how	does	word	of	mouth	affect	business	online
customer	reviews	are	like	that	on	google	my	business	allowing	customers	to	review	stores
and	business	owners	get	to	know	more	about	customers	whether	they	respond	to	reviews	answering	messages	and	questions	and	interacting	with	interested	customers
in	addition	google	has	translation	program	posting	reviews	for	other	languages	is	also	automatically	translated
therefore	there	are	no	longer	language	barriers	in	customer	care	the	business	owner	knows	the	opinions	of	the	customers
it	is	an	insight	into	the	development	of	products	and	services
and	do	promotions	to	meet	customer	satisfaction	leading	to	positive	reviews	and	creating	more	sales	opportunities
according	to	statistics	of	customers	say	positive	reviews	help	them	decide	on	that	store	make	free	real	time	advertising	by	uploading	store	profile	details	key	benefit	of	google	my	business	is	that	business	owners	can	share	general	information	such	as	addresses	locations
phone	numbers	websites	business	hours	and	information	useful	for	customers	purchase	decisions	like	if	it	restaurant	it	is	the	atmosphere	the	restaurant	the	menu	the	food	the	food	etc
this	area	is	like	small	website
let	the	search	person	know	about	your	store	right	away	which	has	significant	effect	on	whether	to	come	to	your	store	or	not
however	adding	phone	numbers	time	to	turn	it	on	and	keep	updating	the	image	is	very	important
because	of	the	statistics	of	customers	tend	to	visit	the	business	show	business	hours	while	of	customers	are	likely	to	visit	businesses	that	show	phone	number	at	the	same	time	customers	will	click	to	request	business	route	with	pictures
up	to	compared	to	when	not	adding	image	and	requesting	business	route	that	is	filled	in	completely	up	to	times	as	much	as	even	in	times	of	crisis	don	let	the	chances	of	your	business	slip	away

we	cannot	deny	that	myanmar	is	one	of	the	countries	that	attract	investors
in	the	past	years	myanmars	gdp	has	continually	grown	with	gdp	growth	of	in	the	year	this	means	that	myanmars	income	continues	to	increase	and	more	investors	are	coming	in
moreover	the	cheap	wage	the	minimum	wage	of	thb	day	also	attracts	investors
as	the	employment	rate	in	myanmar	continues	to	rise	people	have	more	purchasing	power	and	start	to	focus	on	their	health	and	appearances
this	gives	the	cosmetic	market	bright	future
thailand	cosmetic	products	have	long	been	accepted	due	to	their	quality	even	though	they	are	set	at	higher	price	compared	to	the	ones	from	china
in	addition	myanmar	nationals	are	familiar	with	made	in	thailand	products	which	is	strength	that	helps	thai	businesses	to	succeed	in	the	myanmar	market	by	responding	to	the	increasing	peoples	needs
according	to	the	export	data	from	the	thai	custom	it	is	found	that	in	which	was	the	year	that	myanmar	started	opening	their	country	thailand	cosmetic	export	value	reached	mb	and	it	has	been	grown	to	mb	in	the	numbers	show	growth	and	tend	to	increase
since	the	burmese	change	their	core	value	due	to	access	to	the	internet	they	have	been	accepting	more	international	cultures
coupling	with	the	increasing	purchasing	power	and	the	emerging	of	the	modern	trade	industry	it	is	not	difficult	for	thai	cosmetic	brands	to	get	in	myanmars	market
myanmar	has	km	connected	border	with	thailand	with	border	controls	permanents	special	border	trade	areas	border	trade	area	and	temporalis
in	addition	the	asean	free	trade	area	afta	is	also	beneficial
these	make	exporting	cosmetics	to	myanmar	more	convenient	and	myanmar	is	also	gate	to	china	and	india
the	most	famous	thai	cosmetics	are	miss	teen	giffarine	snail	white	and	nok	kaew	soap
because	cosmetics	are	popular	in	myanmar	the	retailer	of	beauty	products	is	established	such	as	beauty	diary	which	is	the	same	as	sephora	in	thailand	with	many	beauty	brands	selling
with	the	market	value	growing	direction	and	the	strength	of	thai	cosmetic	products	this	is	good	opportunity	for	thai	cosmetic	businesses	who	are	interested	in	investing	in	myanmar	to	study	and	prepare	for	related	documents
once	the	covid	situation	is	relieved	they	can	jump	right	into	the	market

businesses	today	are	facing	various	pressures	and	competition	and	smes	must	quickly	adopt	technology	to	increase	their	competitiveness
despite	not	being	new	and	implemented	by	large	firms	for	some	time	smes	can	take	advantage	of	enterprise	resourcing	planning	erp	to	help	increase	their	efficiency
khun	suchada	khotsin	director	of	the	industrial	and	business	development	promotion	and	support	department	of	the	digital	economy	promotion	agency	depa	khun	prawit	marketing	division	manager	business	plus	co	ltd	and	khun	kittipong	ruaifuphan	marketing	director	of	both	tth	knitting	thailand	co	ltd	manufacturer	of	uniforms	and	hybrid	sports	co	ltd	thailands	first	running	event	registration	platform	recently	shared	their	experiences	and	views	on	using	erp	to	manage	orders	and	sales	for	sme	businesses	along	with	tips	on	how	to	get	depa	promotions	and	support
erp	systems	for	smes	khun	kittipong	reminisced	about	his	adoption	of	an	erp	system	to	optimize	tth	knitting	and	hybrid	sports	internal	processes	over	ten	years	ago	at	time	when	his	companies	implemented	package	software
at	that	time	each	program	operated	separately	and	the	data	in	each	system	was	not	linked
when	purchasing	order	was	created	each	department	had	to	waste	time	checking	information	using	several	programs
with	web	based	erp	system	data	from	different	teams	are	linked	including	raw	materials	cost	accounts	customer	information	production	to	delivery	and	payment	collection
information	is	available	in	real	time	allowing	companies	to	shorten	processes	and	approve	deals	without	paperwork
this	not	only	reduces	costs	but	the	system	also	helps	calculate	cash	flow	merchandise	management	raw	material	stocks	and	more
overall	management	is	more	efficient
during	the	latest	wave	of	the	covid	crisis	khun	kittipongs	companies	have	fully	implemented	erp	for	initiating	call	plans	to	contact	customers	in	unaffected	business	groups	such	as	food	packaging	or	cleaning
using	an	erp	to	make	call	plan	helped	him	know	how	many	customers	have	been	contacted	by	his	staff	and	the	success	rate	compared	to	historical	data
that	data	can	be	used	to	create	dashboard	that	enables	him	to	see	all	the	important	data	for	executive	decision	making
the	system	also	allows	the	use	of	historical	data	for	analyzing	past	mistakes	such	as	prices	product	specifications	sales	teams	and	other	information
this	data	enables	his	companies	to	improve	sales	opportunities	for	existing	customers	as	they	are	available	on	the	erp	system
khun	kittipong	suggested	that	time	when	businesses	are	not	making	much	progress	is	the	right	time	to	improve	internal	processes	by	using	erp	to	help	increase	operational	efficiency	in	preparation	for	eventual	economic	recovery
pain	points	of	using	erp	khun	kittipong	also	mentioned	the	main	reasons	discouraging	entrepreneurs	from	implementing	an	erp	system
namely	they	either	do	not	know	how	to	embrace	it	or	their	staff	does	not	have	it	expertise
khun	kittipong	suggested	that	business	owners	first	need	to	change	their	mindsets
an	erp	system	is	not	that	difficult	to	use	and	staff	can	learn	and	upskill
business	owners	should	explore	their	problems
for	example	by	thoroughly	exploring	stocks	sales	accounting	and	payrolls
companies	need	to	identify	their	goals	first	and	then	tell	the	developer	how	to	adjust	the	system	to	meet	their	needs	and	future	business	expansion	plans
finally	systems	can	be	customized	to	suit	businesses	of	various	sizes	from	big	to	small	including	good	after	sales	service	teams	to	provide	advice	and	training
erp	system	for	smes	established	in	business	plus	co	ltd	has	transformed	from	selling	accounting	software	to	developing	package	software
now	business	plus	has	developed	platform	that	integrates	commerce	digital	payments	api	web	service	the	cloud	iot	tax	invoices	and	mobile	applications	for	both	ios	and	android	systems	in	multi	language	format
the	platform	supports	pos	erp	hrm	and	van	sales	mobile	and	has	been	designed	to	suit	the	uniqueness	of	different	businesses	fashion	stationery	building	materials	food	courts	and	more
khun	prawit	remarked	that	during	the	present	era	where	social	media	plays	an	important	role	in	reaching	customers	to	offer	products	business	plus	erp	system	can	connect	store	to	social	media	such	as	line	official	account	line	oa
these	features	enable	stores	to	integrate	purchase	orders	from	line	oa	such	as	products	customer	ids	order	numbers	and	other	relevant	information	to	create	text	file	and	upload	it	to	the	erp	system
information	can	be	used	for	back	office	management	and	to	issue	relevant	documents
entrepreneurs	selling	products	on	marketplace	websites	like	lazada	or	shopee	can	also	link	the	information	to	the	system	as	well	most	people	view	erp	systems	as	belonging	to	big	brands	like	sap	or	oracle	and	doubt	their	practicality	for	thai	businesses
in	fact	the	erp	process	has	been	developed	from	document	flows	allowing	entrepreneurs	to	see	the	overall	business	through	real	time	database
these	features	can	help	increase	efficiency	unlike	in	the	past	when	different	departments	worked	separately	with	documents	and	data	that	were	not	shared	among	different	teams
this	gridlock	can	prevent	companies	from	tracking	their	overall	performance
in	addition	erp	can	analyze	historical	sales	allowing	companies	to	use	that	information	to	boost	sales	with	existing	customers
khun	prawit	added	that	smes	should	not	be	afraid	of	using	technology
using	package	software	is	something	that	can	be	learned
business	plus	has	some	customers	both	in	bangkok	and	provinces
khun	prawit	agreed	with	khun	kittipong	that	this	economic	downturn	is	the	right	time	to	deploy	an	erp	system	because	when	boom	times	return	companies	will	be	busy	and	have	no	time	to	learn	or	prepare	data	for	uploading	to	an	erp	system
this	lockdown	period	is	thus	the	perfect	time	for	implementing	erp	for	improving	internal	processes	and	efficiency	to	ready	business	once	the	situation	goes	back	to	normal	early	next	year

part	the	covid	crisis	makes	everything	in	people	lives	unexpectedly	change
uncertain	future	worries	and	the	lockdown	measures	have	direct	impact	on	the	business	sector	and	the	overall	economy	of	the	country	yunyong	thaicharoen	ph	first	executive	vice	president	of	economic	intelligence	centre	eic	brought	an	interesting	analysis	of	the	impact	that	covid	had	on	the	economy	and	the	thai	labor	market	on	the	following	issues	why	the	crisis	of	covid	therefore	have	greater	impact	on	the	global	economy	than	the	previous	crisis	the	situation	of	the	covid	virus	is	crisis	that	is	more	violent	than	had	previously	occurred	because	it	is	crisis	that	has	spread	around	the	world
unlike	the	hamburger	crisis	in	only	for	the	united	states	and	europe	but	the	asian	side	is	still	good
and	the	tom	yum	kung	crisis	in	affecting	only	thailand	and	asia	do	not	reach	europe	and	the	united	states	but	the	crisis	of	the	covid	severe	worldwide	spread	over	countries	infected	and	more	than	countries	with	more	than	hundred	cases	infected
in	thailand	although	we	can	handle	the	situation	well	the	number	of	infected	people	has	decreased	in	the	form	of	flatten	the	curve	but	they	must	keep	an	eye	on	the	latter	after	the	relaxation	of	the	lockdown	measures
it	is	something	that	countries	in	the	world	are	keeping	an	eye	on	in	their	own	country	as	well	especially	the	testing	for	infected	persons	testing
in	thailand	the	testing	amount	to	cases	equivalent	to	people	per	million	people	which	is	quite	small
therefore	we	need	to	monitor	the	situation	and	testing	measures	during	the	relaxation	after	locking	down
however	when	looking	at	the	log	down	index	of	countries	that	have	closed	cities	to	plot	the	industrial	index	will	come	out	as	downward	sloping	graph
meaning	that	the	more	the	lockdown	industrial	economy	decreased	considerably	pointed	out	that	locking	down	has	significant	implications	for	industrial	economic	output
however	the	economy	will	recover	sooner	or	later
it	not	just	about	locking	down	relaxation
but	depends	on	its	beliefs	and	consumer	behavior	that	will	come	back	to	spend
this	is	where	effective	testing	and	tracking	measures	are	important	in	creating	consumer	confidence
impact	on	thailand	before	covid	and	when	it	happened	the	international	monetary	fund	imf	estimates	that	the	global	economy	will	contract	by	the	worst	since	the	great	depression	years	ago
for	the	thai	economy	began	to	slow	down	since	the	second	half	of
due	to	the	trade	war	situation
seen	from	the	factory	shutdown
drought	situation	that	continuously	affects	agriculture	including	the	budget	for	which	is	approved	later	than	usual	resulting	in	delayed	investment	budgets	as	well
in	the	critical	part	of	the	covid	virus	as	the	thai	economy	relies	heavily	on	foreign	economies	therefore	affecting	the	thai	economy	in	main	areas	as	follows
however	before	the	crisis	of	covid	the	thai	economy	is	already	slowing	down	based	on	the	first	weeks	of	from	january	until	before	the	lockdown	period	in	mid	march	the	number	of	newly	opened	businesses	decreased	by	from	the	same	period	last	year
while	the	number	of	closed	businesses	increased	by	indicating	that	new	businesses	were	less	than	businesses	that	had	to	close
impact	on	citizens	and	remedies	from	the	government	yanyong	sees	that	the	most	worrisome	thing	is	the	vulnerability	of	the	thai	household	sector
according	to	the	latest	national	statistical	office	data	in	from	population	of	million	households	million	households	have	reserve	funds	available	for	less	than	months	of	normal	expenses	and	up	to	million	households	with	reserve	savings	valid	for	month	from	the	said	information	therefore	it	is	important	that	the	government	both	the	ministry	of	finance	and	the	bank	of	thailand	have	the	policy	to	issue	measures	to	help	businesses	and	the	public
such	as	relief	measures	of	billion	baht	and	an	economic	recovery	plan	of	billion	baht
or	in	the	bot	section	soft	loans	have	been	issued	to	smes	as	well	as	private	equity	bond	funds	that	are	due
for	further	measures	after	this	it	depends	on	the	epidemic	situation	whether	lockdown	is	needed
if	necessary	continue	must	have	continued	healing	for	the	people	the	ministry	of	finance	and	the	bot	are	ready	to	adjust	measures	to	help	the	people
which	is	good	thing	that	the	overall	thai	economy	is	relatively	stable	public	debt	is	not	very	high
therefore	it	can	raise	short	term	funds	to	look	after	the	people
which	injects	money	directly	into	the	public	like	baht	remedy	will	see	the	results	quite	quickly	by	using	the	money	to	spend	immediately
as	for	investment	stimulus	measures	must	look	at	the	level	of	investment	readiness	if	there	are	already	supported	projects	the	infusion	of	money	will	stimulate	employment	buy	building	materials	etc
that	also	see	results	quite	quickly	as	well
real	time	numbers	indicate	unemployment	increases	from	the	national	statistical	office	numbers	the	workforce	numbers	in	thailand	are	million	people
the	most	vulnerable	sectors	are	tourism	restaurants	recreation	services	as	well	as	retail	wholesale	and	part	time	groups	and	private	business	owners	in	this	business	group
according	to	jobsdb	com	from	march	to	the	present	may	the	number	of	job	postings	has	steadily	decreased
regular	job	postings	decreased	by	and	part	time	job	postings	were	reduced	by	more	than
the	lower	the	salary	the	fewer	skills	that	may	be	employed	in	the	tourism	sector	the	most
but	overall	apart	from	government	work	and	all	business	groups	decreased
this	real	time	data	reflects	the	conditions	in	the	labor	market	where	business	sectors	are	striving	to	not	hire	new	jobs
even	in	some	business	groups	that	can	expand	such	as	online	digital	commerce	delivery	health	care	which	must	be	adapted	online	for	business
however	the	overall	atmosphere	of	employment	has	slowed	down
which	will	affect	the	group	of	new	graduates
khun	yanyong	recommends	while	waiting	for	the	employment	conditions	to	improve	which	is	expected	to	occur	in	the	second	half	of	the	year	should	learn	more	about	digital	online	business	that	is	needed	to	meet	the	employment	in	these	businesses	with	the	situation	of	the	covid	virus	that	affected	all	and	brings	about	something	called	new	normal	that	makes	lifestyles	around	the	world	different	from	before

rather	than	being	an	automotive	start	up	the	electric	motorcycle	manufacturer	etran	has	the	purpose	of	being	more	committed	to	the	development	of	clean	energy	vehicles
to	improve	the	quality	of	life
and	inspires	society	to	pay	more	attention	to	the	environment	with	the	idea	that	the	main	customer	is	our	world	that	will	pass	on	to	the	next	generation	read	about	the	establishment	of	an	electric	motorcycle	business	by	khun	soranun	chuchat	ceo	of	etran	who	has	thinking	method	to	answer	the	needs	of	real	users
with	the	production	process	that	is	most	environmentally	friendly	and	how	to	cope	with	the	crisis
opportunity	to	think	and	develop	new	products	and	business	to	our	world	the	first	hardware	startup	the	first	hardware	startup	most	familiar	startups	tend	to	be	in	application	development
but	etran	is	the	first	hardware	startup	in	thailand
khun	soranun	chuchat	or	khun	earth	ceo	of	etran	sees	that	in	fact	it	does	not	emphasize	whether	it	is	hardware	or	software
ethan	focus	is	on	solving	the	pain	point	problem	of	clean	and	environmentally	friendly	mobility
because	as	we	know	mobility	is	one	of	the	main	environmental	problems
which	for	years	ago	it	has	been	talking	about	electric	vehicles	that	will	be	the	solution	to	the	problem
create	clean	transport	good	for	our	world	by	etran	see	that	the	company	customers	are	our	world
why	etran	started	with	motorcycles	taxis
the	beginning	of	etran	came	five	years	ago
at	that	time	khun	earth	was	working	in	an	office	near	thonglor
he	took	motorcycle	to	bts
along	the	way	he	must	travel	amidst	the	smell	of	toxic	smoke	exhaust	pipes
these	terrible	environments	are	the	pain	point	for	motorcyclists	and	passengers	who	must	venture	on	the	road	every	day
important	the	motorbike	is	not	designed	to	be	pillion	in	public	transportation	but	was	invented	for	personal	use
therefore	when	using	public	transport	it	is	not	comfortable	and	accident	prone
this	sparked	the	idea	for	earth	to	build	an	electric	motorcycle
come	to	meet	the	needs	of	transportation	that	will	help	make	our	society	and	the	world	better
do	research	with	the	target	audience	to	answer	this	question	earth	and	his	team	have	been	exploring	the	needs	of	more	than	win	motorbike	drivers
request	ideas	on	product	ideas	and	drawings	which	received	positive	feedback
and	from	the	conclusion	what	the	target	groups	want	are	performance	speed	distance
the	etran	team	also	invented	the	first	prototype	product	the	etran	prom	electric	moped	stands	for	electric	and	earth
the	first	product	launch	was	the	scb	digital	ventures	accelerator	dva	platform
which	gained	from	this	program	is	entrepreneurial	skills	to	help	fulfill	business	matters	and	the	opportunity	to	meet	other	startups	etran	objectives	and	goals	for	etran	the	concept	of	doing	business	is	not	just	vehicle	manufacturing
but	is	to	change	the	way	of	traveling	by	public	transport
which	is	one	of	the	indicators	of	the	city	prosperity
it	is	both	opportunity	responsibility	and	sustainability
etran	wants	to	be	sustainable	startup	that	gives	importance	to	coexistence	in	sustainable	ecosystem
through	the	product	of	electric	motorcycles	that	are	good	for	the	world	and	persuade	people	to	do	things	that	make	the	world	better
in	the	competition	khun	earth	thinks	that	if	there	are	big	brands	to	compete	is	good	because	it	will	bring	good	things	to	the	world	more
in	the	beginning	he	was	afraid	that	there	would	be	big	brands	to	produce	competitive	products
in	his	opinion	etran	is	not	just	making	motorcycle	but	creating	an	ecosystem	of	eco	friendly	mobility
which	is	an	opportunity	for	doing	other	related	businesses	such	as	hire	purchase	loans	various	facilities	such	as	chart	points	etc
etran	goals	are	reduce	greenhouse	gas	emissions
equivalent	to	planting	hundred	thousand	trees
improving	people	quality	of	life	remaining	money	reducing	fuel	costs	because	electric	energy	can	be	produced	from	renewable	sources
it	will	help	win	drivers	lower	costs	fuel	hire	purchase	resulting	in	more	savings	and	better	quality	of	life
must	be	able	to	give	back	to	society	can	make	the	world	better
because	having	thai	brand	car	is	good	for	the	economy	and	makes	learning	technology	in	the	education	sector	good	quality	people	better	society	and	sustainable	environment
it	is	balance	in	all	aspects	as	etran	is	start	up	that	values	sustainability
use	technology	to	save	the	world	on	the	use	of	technology	to	save	the	world	besides	electric	power	that	does	not	emit	smoke	then	etran	also	pays	attention	to	materials
because	before	using	plastic	that	when	broken	must	be	discarded
became	waste	of	the	world
therefore	we	must	think	of	new	material	and	switch	to	natural	fiber	plastic	material	made	from	cassava	which	is	our	agricultural	product
by	using	to	make	parts	at	the	point	of	frequent	collisions	which	the	cost	did	not	increase
but	what	we	get	is	social	value	proud	of	being	thai
as	etran	is	start	up	it	has	strengths	think	and	can	do	it	fast
unlike	big	vehicle	companies	that	stick	to	the	formula	original	production	model	and	dont	want	to	change
from	the	first	group	of	customers	are	investors	later	there	are	about	win	motorbike	drivers	nationwide
now	portion	of	over	people	know	etran	and	are	doing	more	in	the	market
the	next	target	is	the	heavy	user	logistic	group	such	as	transport
from	the	information	that	driving	motorcycle	every	kilometers	emits	kilograms	of	carbon	gas	if	this	can	be	reduced
thailand	will	be	the	world	first	clean	transportation	country
elements	of	the	etran	business	model	the	etran	business	model	is	divided	into	parts	electric	motorcycle	production	car	rental	leasing	by	using	the	sharing	economy	model	use	then	pay	not	use	not	pay
this	will	help	the	driver	to	earn	money	from	transportation
services	such	as	maintenance	of	the	battery	charging	point
works	with	ptt	as	partner	in	the	area	of	swop	battery	etc
to	build	infrastructure	to	support	the	entire	ecosystem
khun	earth	talks	about	the	price	that	the	product	was	initially	priced	high	at	six	digits
because	it	is	full	of	efficiency	and	high	cost	because	of	small	production
causing	the	leasing	model	where	the	team	talked	to	the	driver	and	found	that	the	range	of	rent	that	they	can	pay	is	around	baht	including	all	costs
which	is	the	daily	rental	fee	of	approximately	baht	per	day

in	the	purchase	solution	the	most	expensive	part	of	the	motorcycle	is	the	battery
at	first	it	was	expensive	because	it	was	packed	full	of	many	batteries

such	as	swop	the	battery	etc	which	is	thought	to	be	up	site	down	to	find	solution	in	terms	of	price	currently	there	are	business	sectors	organizations	interested	in	contacting	etran	motorbikes	to	test

in	way	operation	that	would	shake	hands	with	many	partners	was	stopped	because	the	partners	operation	was	closed
in	the	travel	business	things	are	bad	such	as	planes	ships	etc
this	situation	prompted	etran	to	revisit	the	business	plan	team	structure	how	it	should	work
and	the	position	of	the	company	that	we	have	been	trying	to	be	something	for	years
but	we	will	not	be	able	to	use	this	effort	for	the	next	years
in	years	we	may	be	able	to	make	motorcycle	but	what	is	new	mindset	for	the	next	years
the	answer	is	etran	is	not	car	company	not	mobility	but	the	vehicle	brand	that	benefits	the	world	the	most
we	don	need	to	sell	hundred	billion	vehicles	like	big	company

it	is	startup	that	demonstrates	sustainability	in	any	context
this	is	not	just	matter	of	products	only	it	is	social	movement

presently	lao	people	democratic	republic	in	the	eyes	of	foreign	investors	is	seen	as	continuously	developing	country	in	terms	of	economy	industry	tourism	life	of	people
it	is	also	an	emerging	country	worth	investing	in	both	in	terms	of	gdp	growth	rate	of	in	which	is	now	expected	to	reach	in	and	there	are	abundant	natural	resources
therefore	this	laos	is	called	trade	gateway	or	land	link	because	it	has	long	area	and	borders	with	china	vietnam	myanmar	and	cambodia	which	are	important	countries	in	driving	the	economy
this	makes	it	conducive	to	transportation	and	logistics	systems
in	addition	although	laos	has	population	of	only	million	it	has	significantly	higher	purchasing	power	especially	products	from	thailand	which	has	been	continuously	favored	among	lao	consumers
to	promote	and	provide	opportunities	for	thai	entrepreneurs	who	are	interested	in	doing	business	or	are	doing	business	in	laos	to	see	the	channel	so	the	factors	that	make	the	development	of	logistics	business	between	thailand	and	laos	is	of	interest	now
this	is	because	of	the	opening	of	the	lao	pdr	china	railway	that	connects	both	the	rail	and	road	goods	routes
to	accommodate	the	transition	from	railways	with	track	size	of	meters	and	track	size	of	meter	from	thailand	arrive	at	na	leng	land	port	for	distance	of	km
the	construction	has	been	completed	and	was	opened	in	june	in	addition	to	helping	to	promote	thai	lao	border	trade
what	thailand	will	benefit	from	this	train	is	that	the	northeastern	region	of	the	provinces	will	connect	the	transportation	system	of	lao	pdr	to	asean	makes	it	easy	to	import	and	export	goods	between	the	borders
land	link	or	the	use	of	link	service	is	route	that	transports	goods
if	goods	from	china	are	transported	to	thailand	and	asean	including	products	from	thailand	that	will	be	sent	to	china	and	europe	land	link	services	will	have	more	cash	left	in	the	business	than	before
it	was	found	that	in	the	trade	value	of	provinces	in	the	northeastern	region	of	thailand	and	china	is	trillion	baht
thailand	and	the	european	union	with	value	of	approximately	trillion	baht	therefore	the	development	of	the	linkage	route	of	lao	pdr	is	like	new	water	pipe	and	golden	opportunity	for	thai	investors
because	new	routes	were	opened	such	as	sea	transport	to	the	east	coast	at	the	port	of	wung	ang	hoping	to	attract	customers	from	isaan	to	use	the	service
because	it	is	shortcut	distance	from	the	thai	border	from	nakhon	phanom	to	the	pier	only	km
this	train	route	construction	will	begin	in	november	it	is	estimated	that	in	about	years	it	will	be	completed
we	cannot	deny	that	this	route	may	pull	some	customers	out	of	laem	chabang	port
for	products	that	will	go	to	japan	america	china	taiwan	because	the	price	is	cheaper
the	original	route	through	laem	chabang
new	investment	sites	to	watch	in	the	lao	pdr	market	in	laos	currently	has	special	economic	zones	namely	savannakhet	district	located	in	savannakhet	province	boten	dankham	district	located	in	luang	namtha	province	golden	triangle	district
located	in	ton	phueng	town	bokeo	subdistrict	phu	khiao	special	district	located	in	khammuan	subdistrict	non	thong	industrial	and	commercial	zone	located	in	vientiane	capital	xaya	settha	combined	development	zone	located	in	vientiane	capital	dong	pho	si	district	located	in	vientiane	capital	bueng	that	luang	specific	area	located	in	vientiane	capital	long	thanh	dedicated	district	located	in	vientiane	capital	thakhek	special	district	champasak	special	district	luang	prabang	special	district
there	are	two	special	economic	zones	that	are	currently	interesting	among	investors	namely	udomxay	one	of	the	northern	new	market	located	in	the	enclave	of	phongsaly	province	luang	prabang	is	currently	classified	as	special	economic	zone	and	open	to	foreign	investors	to	invest	in	large	numbers	because	it	is	the	center	of	logistics	thus	creating	smart	city	smart	city	by	businesses	that	are	suitable	for	investment	is	agricultural	products	including	the	cultivation	of	maize	soybeans	rubber	non	toxic	vegetables	and	plants	used	as	alternative	energy	in	terms	of	mining	resources	such	as	zinc	and	iron	etc
in	addition	oudomxay	province	is	city	where	the	china	laos	high	speed	train	runs	through
to	support	more	freight	forwarding	which	was	opened	for	use	in	so	this	district	is	suitable	and	worth	doing	business	in	logistics
thai	businessmen	who	are	interested	in	investing	in	real	estate	sales	management	or	investment	in	setting	up	distribution	centers	car	accommodation	new	city	shopping	centers	and	it	centers	should	hurry	to	study	and	invest	for	business	opportunities
luang	namtha	special	economic	zone	that	is	characterized	by	the	northern	area	adjacent	to	china	in	yunnan	province	and	on	the	west	side	next	to	myanmar	with	an	area	that	is	easy	to	trade	with	many	countries	including	another	city	that	the	thai	china	laos	railway	cuts	through
as	result	travel	and	transportation	will	be	faster
in	the	future	luang	namtha	province	will	become	an	important	border	point	that	will	attract	large	number	of	chinese	tourists
this	makes	it	suitable	for	tourism	businesses	such	as	tourism	hotels	food	and	beverages	souvenirs	and	transportation	etc
it	is	an	opportunity	for	thai	entrepreneurs
who	have	expertise	in	the	tourism	sector
in	addition	luang	namtha	province	is	also	located	on	the	route	which	is	an	important	transportation	route	connecting	thailand	chiang	rai	laos	china	kunming
making	it	point	of	transporting	goods	into	china	by	land	and	the	important	mekong	river
opportunities	and	tips	for	thai	investors	culture	and	lifestyle	of	lao	people	product	naming	techniques	in	general	most	lao	people	choose	quality	products	and	are	familiar	with	using	the	same	brand
it	makes	me	believe	that	the	new	formula	must	always	be	better	than	the	old	formula
therefore	if	new	product	is	produced	it	must	be	clearly	stated	that	it	is	new	formula	and	the	quality	of	the	product	must	be	better	than	the	original	formula
because	most	lao	people	tend	to	trust	close	people	more	than	word	of	mouth	advertising
therefore	if	the	product	is	not	really	good	it	will	definitely	affect	sales
in	addition	lao	people	believe	in	the	meaning	of	the	word
therefore	the	product	name	must	be	word	that	has	auspicious	meanings	such	as	have	wealth	have	luck	and	should	be	an	easy	to	remember	name
online	marketing	for	entrepreneurs	they	should	not	focus	on	selling	products	through	facebook	channels	only	one	channel	because	the	facebook	usage	rate	of	lao	people	is	only
if	you	want	to	advertise	you	should	choose	to	use	motivational	messages	or	to	install	large	advertising	signs	such	as	tracking	taxis
or	along	the	way
but	be	careful	and	study	the	language	usage	although	isan	of	thailand	is	similar	to	lao	but	the	meaning	of	some	words	is	different
shareholding	able	to	hold	shares	in	the	freight	forwarding	agency	business	in	lao	pdr	with	shareholding	of	not	more	than	except	in	the	case	of	establishing	branch	office	or	representative	office	can	hold	majority	of	shares	and	must	be	approved	by	the	lao	foreign	investment	management	committee
and	in	the	case	of	hiring	lao	employees	foreign	investors	must	provide	training	for	lao	workers	to	upgrade	their	skills	or	send	lao	employees	to	train	abroad
important	transportation	sources	in	lao	pdr	most	of	the	logistics	business	is	based	in	vientiane
since	it	is	the	main	economic	city	there	are	also	important	border	trade	checkpoints	such	as	the	friendship	bridge	checkpoint
vientiane	boten	toll	plaza	luang	nam	tha	province	dansavanh	toll	plaza	and	the	savannakhet	checkpoint	savannakhet	huai	sai	toll	bo	kaeo	nong	nok	khian	checkpoint	chaweng	attapeu	thakhek	and	napha	toll	plazas	khammouan	wang	tao	toll	plazas	champasak	province	kaen	thao	toll	plaza	chaiburi	province	and	pak	san	toll	plaza	bolikhamxay	province
trade	contacts	emphasis	is	on	collaborating	with	entrepreneurs	in	the	lao	freight	forwarders	association	liffa	and	targeting	thai	customers	who	import	export	products	to	laos
major	products	such	as	refined	oil	foodstuffs	consumer	goods	machinery	cement	and	construction	equipment	etc
the	train	route	that	is	beneficial	to	investors	through	the	new	transport	routes	china	laos	electric	train	thai	entrepreneurs	can	build	distribution	center	business	and	logistic	in	the	form	of	joint	venture	with	lao	entrepreneurs	to	take	advantage	of	the	privilege	of	crossing	to	neighboring	countries	and	service	businesses	that	thailand	has	expertise	in	such	as	hotels	restaurants	souvenir	shops	and	massage	spas
however	thai	investors	should	study	regulations	related	to	trade	and	investment	should	be	done	well	before	investing
moreover	agriculture	and	livestock	business	can	rely	on	trade	benefits	to	export	to	china	because	it	is	country	that	has	borders	and	good	relations	between	the	chinese	and	lao	governments

if	counting	until	june	the	china	laos	railway	have	total	of	million	passengers	transported	by	railways	within	lao	pdr	which	has	served	hundred	thousand	passengers	million	tons	of	freight	trains	and	goods	across	the	china	laos	border	so	far
hundred	thousand	tons	at	present	lao	pdr	is	considered	country	to	keep	an	eye	on
because	the	government	pays	attention	to	the	infrastructure	system	and	open	the	country	for	more	investors	to	invest	in	laos
therefore	trading	with	lao	people	is	not	challenge	beyond	the	ability	of	thai	entrepreneurs
because	lao	people	believe	in	thai	products	as	the	original	capital
therefore	it	is	considered	an	advantage	that	thai	products	will	have	the	opportunity	to	export	and	penetrate	the	lao	market
for	this	reason	the	information	that	thai	entrepreneurs	receive	will	be	useful	and	help	their	business	to	be	successful

most	business	operators	often	think	that	having	their	own	business	name	on	the	first	page	of	google	search	results	is	one	of	the	best	ways	to	reach	potential	customers	generate	sales	and	profit
but	in	fact	this	is	not	the	answer	to	all	if	we	do	not	have	the	right	search	marketing	strategy
mr	pakorn	monsiriruengdet	bird	founder	of	ads	now	google	premier	partner	google	product	expert	appointed	by	google	will	answer	all	questions	in	search	marketing	to	be	the	most	effective
google	ads	vs	seo	when	entering	search	keyword	google	search	results	will	be	divided	into	parts	google	ad	in	the	upper	area	which	can	be	used	to	buy	money	to	make	the	website	of	the	business	to	appear
another	part	is	seo	search	engine	optimization	which	is	website	that	is	on	the	first	page	in	an	organic	way
keywords	are	of	appropriate	quality	in	accordance	with	search	engine	performance
mr	pakorn	summarizes	the	differences	between	google	ad	and	seo	as	follows	google	ads	charges	pay	per	click
you	will	be	charged	when	someone	clicks	on	the	link	so	the	cost	per	lead	is	worth	when	compared	to	other	types	of	advertising
and	when	the	ad	set	is	complete	it	will	be	displayed	within	minutes
you	can	choose	the	target	audience	gender	age	location	language	and	keyword	that	you	want	to	see	ad
theres	flexibility	in	budget	ability	to	adjust	budget	according	to	the	season	of	the	business	an	outstanding	in	flexibility	and	see	results
seo	even	if	you	don	have	to	pay	for	advertising
but	there	are	other	costs	that	require	human	effort	time	to	make	website	appear	in	google	search	and	can	be	on	the	first	page	immediately
it	takes	months	to	invest	and	put	in	effort	to	do	it	first	which	if	we	do	seo	for	the	website	can	be	on	the	first	page
if	the	keyword	is	popular	there	will	be	lot	of	people	searching	for	our	business	without	any	additional	investment
here	are	reasons	why	google	ads	is	good	for	businesses	get	people	with	specific	interests	google	ads	can	target	customers	more	targeted	than	facebook	ads
for	example	furniture	wholesaler	google	ads	will	run	ads	for	people	to	search	by	keyword	sell	sofas	at	wholesale	prices	find	manufacturers	while	in	facebook	ads
will	approach	people	interested	in	general	furniture	including	freedom	to	choose	keywords	that	are	suitable	for	businesses	with	specialized	products	because	you	can	buy	keywords	for	specific	products
get	people	who	are	interested	at	that	time	google	ads	has	the	strength	to	get	people	who	are	interested	really	in	buying	more	currently	search	keywords
make	it	more	likely	to	sell	products	while	facebook	ads	that	select	the	target	audience	based	on	their	interests
maybe	run	to	meet	people	who	are	starting	to	be	interested	or	finished	the	purchase	budget	in	relation	to	market	demand	budget	can	be	used	appropriately	for	the	season	of	the	product	less	searcher	less	budget
during	the	peak	period	there	are	many	people	searching	can	increase	the	budget	allowing	the	business	to	control	expenses	in	accordance	with	the	market	demand	unlike	facebook	ads	which	focuses	on	spending	money	running	ads	for	customers	to	see	as	much	as	possible	regardless	of	market	demand
flexible	budgeting	increase	decrease	the	budget	to	suit	the	time	period	that	customers	are	expected	to	find	such	as	season	weekends	and	holidays	time	after	work	etc
specify	the	location	language	google	ads	can	advertise	in	other	countries	and	change	the	language
so	it	way	for	businesses	to	try	to	market	other	countries	leading	to	business	expansion	abroad
try	new	products	and	services	all	the	time	when	there	is	an	idea	for	new	product	or	service	use	google	ads	to	shoot	market	trial	ads
which	will	know	the	feedback	quickly	easy	to	measure	and	concrete	results	we	will	know	the	keywords	that	we	choose	to	buy	and	make	google	ads	how	they	get	results	how	much	which	keywords	how	much	they	cost
measure	advertising	results	in	concrete	way	businesses	can	continue	to	improve	their	advertising	plans	the	hearts	of	google	ads	for	sustainable	business	results	mr	pakorn	emphasized	the	factors	that	will	make	the	business	more	profitable	with	google	ads	that	consist	of	things	that	need	to	be	focused	as	follows	objectives	goals	businesses	must	set	clear	objectives	kpis	for	example	the	business	needs	awareness	or	sales
if	you	want	both	you	must	clearly	divide	the	proportion	of	the	budget	to	answer	each	objective	for	example	the	budget	to	create	awareness	sales	etc
because	this	will	affect	the	bidding	strategy	that	is	the	engine	of	google	ads
keywords	insights	the	better	you	know	your	customers
it	will	be	easier	to	sell	products	for	example	if	you	know	who	plays	role	in	purchasing	decisions	and	what	words	they	use	to	call	the	name	of	the	product	besides	the	technical	term	we	can	also	buy	keywords	words	that	customers	can	find	our	business
that	is	if	we	understand	insight	customers	will	know	other	terms
which	he	uses	to	call	the	name	of	the	product	and	lead	to	the	purchase	of	keywords	effectively	mr	pakorn	uses	the	keywords	funnel	theory	to	manage	the	purchase	of	keywords	by	dividing	the	funnel	into	steps	namely	awareness	consideration	purchase	intent
while	the	purchase	rate	will	be	from	ascending	to	high	which	the	characteristics	of	each	keyword	are	different
in	the	awareness	keyword	stage	is	broad	word	then	go	specific	until	you	reach	the	purchase	intent	stage
it	the	keyword
enter	the	product	details	that	you	will	actually	buy
for	example	looking	for	package	manufacturer
keyword	at	the	awareness	stage	is	lotion	bottle	packaging	later	in	the	consideration	keyword	stage
it	narrows	into	beautiful	lotion	bottle
beautiful	packaging	lotion	bottle	production	lotion	bottle	factory	comes	to	the	word	production	of	lotion	bottles	with	screen	produce	bottles	of	food	supplements	tea	color	at	purchase	intent	stage	keyword	acquisition	awareness	and	consideration	stage
this	is	to	create	familiarity	for	customers	to	know	about	our	business	but	buying	keywords	at	the	purchase	intent	stage	is	the	most	important	because	if	customers	decide	to	buy	and	search	cannot	find	our	business
we	will	lose	this	customer	to	other	competitors	that	the	search	customer	encounters	at	that	time
keyword	in	the	purchase	intent	stage	will	help	us	not	miss	the	opportunity	to	lose	customers	to	other	competitors
landing	page	branding	this	relates	to	customer	psychology	location	and	language	in	creating	landing	page	that	makes	our	business	stand	out	from	competitors	appearing	on	the	same	search	page	as	us
and	attract	customers	to	choose	to	contact	us	in	order	to	write	good	landing	page	you	have	to	start	with	understanding	your	customers	what	factors	affect	their	decisions	including	branding	website	content	ad	text	video	images	etc
good	ad	text	customers	like	concrete	messages	such	as	numbers	percentages	and	keywords	that	we	buy	in	the	text
emphasize	selling	points	answer	the	questions	of	the	target	customers	ad	extension	ad	extension	add	function	call	contact	map	link	to	the	storefront	sub	pages	on	the	website	special	promotions	etc
measuring	and	improving	ads	businesses	can	measure	google	ads	results	which	keywords	yield	good	and	bad	results
leads	to	improving	ads	for	better	sales	and	profits
conversion	tracking	giving	customers	online	action	that	we	define	as	measure	of	success	such	as	buy	request	quote	add	line	facebook	inbox	subscribe	etc	to	track	google	ads	conversion	count	it	can	be	done	by	setting	the	page	used	can	measure	conversion	from	the	experience	that	khun	pakorn	has	given	advice	to	entrepreneurs	most	of	the	search	marketing	efforts	are	not	as	effective	as	they	should	be
this	is	due	to	keyword	selection	that	doesn	answer	the	question	chooses	the	network	doesn	answer	your	own	purpose	doesn	do	well	landing	page	doesn	do	remarketing	doesn	measure	results	etc
therefore	if	the	entrepreneur	understands	the	mechanism	of	google	ads	and	the	factors	that	affect	ads
very	well	will	be	able	to	use	search	marketing	strategies	effectively

at	the	beginning	of	vietnam	was	recognized	as	the	only	asean	country	to	avoid	falling	into	recession	during	the	covid	pandemic	and	has	gained	the	status	of	an	alternative	production	base	to	china
the	ministry	of	commerces	department	of	international	trade	promotion	ditp	reported	that	in	the	first	nine	months	of	the	vietnam	automobile	manufacturers	association	vama	recorded	sales	of	vehicles	an	increase	of	yoy
during	april	august	car	sales	declined	continuously	due	to	the	covid	situation	widespread	within	the	country
when	the	situation	improved	sales	of	vama	members	rebounded	in	september	to	units	an	increase	of	compared	to	august	time	when	car	sales	were	the	lowest	since	the	increase	was	sign	of	good	growth	resulting	in	the	growth	of	auto	part	exports	from	thailand	which	is	one	of	vietnams	major	trading	partners

by	nakarin	wanakijpaibul	look	up	to	the	sky
vision	is	the	north	star	that	will	guide	you
hi	light	many	companies	fail	not	because	of	wrong	decisions	on	the	contrary	they	made	good	decisions	but	they	fail	because	they	made	decisions	too	slowly	bald	man	once	made	this	statement
he	then	added	that	when	you	need	to	make	decision	dont	wait	until	you	get	or	more	of	the	information	as	waiting	would	cause	you	to	make	the	decision	too	slowly
you	must	be	courageous	and	willing	to	take	risks
accept	that	you	will	fail	sometimes	knowing	that	it	is	not	the	end	of	the	world
the	question	is	then	what	should	decisions	be	based	on
vision	is	his	answer
this	man	jeff	bezos	is	one	of	the	worlds	richest	men	having	assets	valued	at	baht	while	thai	gdp	is	about	baht
between	and	new	commerce	business	similar	to	amazon	had	been	growing	rapidly	but	it	was	forecasted	to	not	grow	any	further
at	that	time	bezos	was	in	his	early	and	he	realized	that	commerce	was	only	just	beginning
he	wrote	letter	to	the	shareholders	that	presented	vision	of	commerce	as	the	future	of	shopping
in	the	future	product	searches	online	will	be	leveraged	with	personalization	and	respond	to	specific	targets
this	clear	and	precise	vision	is	the	key	to	his	fast	decision	making	ability
thats	why	bezos	chose	long	term	investments	in	strong	established	companies	rather	than	companies	that	had	high	returns	in	the	short	term
he	invested	in	structure	in	order	to	expand	amazon	customer	base	knowing	with	confidence	that	customers	would	keep	buying	products	through	amazon	as	they	had	before
he	focused	more	on	building	strong	brand	than	on	expanding	to	other	markets	for	short	term	gains
having	vision	helped	him	to	differentiate	between	what	was	good	and	what	was	bad	for	the	organization
moving	from	seattle	the	home	city	of	amazon	over	to	the	university	of	pennsylvania	where	young	south	african	man	with	broad	shoulders	was	making	up	his	mind	about	what	to	do	after	college
his	dreams	kept	repeating	themselves	and	they	all	had	to	do	with	the	internet	clean	energy	and	space	travel
he	came	to	believe	that	these	three	innovations	would	undergo	tremendous	change	in	the	years	ahead	and	that	he	could	make	big	splash	in	those	markets
thus	he	committed	himself	and	focused	on	work	in	just	these	industries
the	guy	we	are	talking	about	is	elon	musk	the	founder	of	spacex	tesla	motors	and	solarcity
he	clearly	stated	from	the	time	he	was	young	that	he	wasn	just	chasing	money
what	he	has	been	chasing	over	the	years	are	big	ideas
dont	want	to	be	follower	of	trends	or	an	opportunist
im	not	an	investor
love	to	turn	technology	to	reality	because	well	need	it	in	the	future	the	guy	we	are	talking	about	is	elon	musk	the	founder	of	spacex	tesla	motors	and	solarcity
he	clearly	stated	from	the	time	he	was	young	that	he	wasn	just	chasing	money
what	he	has	been	chasing	over	the	years	are	big	ideas
dont	want	to	be	follower	of	trends	or	an	opportunist
im	not	an	investor
love	to	turn	technology	to	reality	because	well	need	it	in	the	future	jumping	from	the	usa	over	to	the	ploenchit	area	in	central	bangkok	was	gazing	into	the	blue	eyes	of	ben	king	director	of	google	in	thailand
in	british	australian	accent	he	told	me	about	the	importance	of	having	vision	that	is	brave
you	need	to	have	brave	vision	for	the	long	term
this	vision	is	not	to	be	added	to	from	time	to	time	or	re	drafted	on	quarterly	or	yearly	basis
need	something	to	inspire	our	teams
as	the	leader	place	high	priority	on	time	management	and	dedicate	much	of	my	time	to	thinking	about	long	term	perspectives	achievable	targets	and	where	we	want	to	be	at	that	moment	the	notion	of	thinking	has	enabled	google	to	create	world	changing	innovations	again	and	again
this	simply	means	that	when	you	try	to	improve	something	you	should	try	to	improve	it	by	factor	of	ten
the	power	of	vision	acts	as	compass	guiding	you	to	where	you	want	to	go
its	the	highest	ideal	for	your	company
its	also	the	passion	that	drives	you
beyond	all	this	your	company	vision	is	an	expression	of	its	essence	to	the	world
without	vision	company	cannot	succeed
here	sampling	of	visions	from	the	world	most	successful	companies
amazon	to	be	earth	most	customer	centric	company	to	build	place	where	people	can	come	to	find	and	discover	anything	they	might	want	to	buy	online	space	revolutionise	space	technology	with	the	ultimate	goal	of	enabling	people	to	live	on	other	planets	google	to	provide	access	to	the	world	information	in	one	click	starbucks	to	inspire	and	nurture	the	human	spirit	one	person	one	cup	and	one	neighborhood	at	time	facebook	give	people	the	power	to	build	community	and	bring	the	world	closer	together
or	how	about	my	own	vision	for	the	standard	news	agency
to	present	information	in	new	ways	that	provide	more	knowledge	thought	understanding	and	inspiration	to	the	people	with	the	ultimate	goal	of	creating	positive	change	for	society
vision	looks	lot	like	dream	of	the	future	and	it	expresses	how	the	company	expects	it	will	change	the	world
company	vision	statement	is	different	from	its	mission	statement	because	vision	statement	doesnt	need	to	describe	actions	the	company	will	take
it	also	differs	from	goal	because	it	doesnt	need	to	state	time	frame	for	vision	to	occur
then	why	is	vision	so	important
research	shows	that	that	employee	who	understands	their	company	vision	have	engagement	levels	of	percent	which	is	points	above	average
accordingly	more	involved	employees	are	more	productive	employees
personally	think	company	vision	is	lot	like	the	north	star	polaris
its	compass	point	can	use	to	lead	my	organization	including	myself	in	the	right	direction
when	we	fail	and	fall	into	despair	our	heads	turn	down	and	then	there	is	fear	of	being	lost	because	we	do	not	know	if	we	are	on	the	right	track	anymore
however	if	we	just	look	up	and	find	that	we	are	not	still	heading	towards	the	north	star	then	we	can	simply	adjust	course	back	to	our	north	star
those	who	dont	have	their	own	north	stars	will	surely	get	lost	along	the	way
more	tragically	without	north	star	to	keep	them	in	straight	line	they	will	travel	in	circles	and	waste	all	their	energy
all	that	you	need	to	do	to	find	your	own	north	star	is	to	look	up	to	the	sky
creative	innovation	is	word	that	is	often	heard	everywhere	among	working	personals
at	this	time	many	organizations	wish	for	creative	innovation	to	happen
so	what	causes	innovation
capitals	technology	capable	leaders	or	talented	individuals
mr	rawit	hanutsaha	ceo	of	srichand	united	dispensary	has	shared	his	opinion	about	this	on	the	innovators	mindset
where	does	innovation	exist
mr	rawit	said	that	nowadays	many	organizations	establish	an	innovative	team	to	specifically	work	on	creativity
however	innovation	is	not	work	of	just	one	department	and	it	is	not	something	that	can	be	forced	to	happen
this	is	because	innovation	is	process	that	gradually	rooting	in	everyday	working	and	it	will	not	exist	in	place	that	failure	results	in	punishment	as	nobody	would	want	to	risk	doing	new	things	if	they	could	get	punished
in	fact	organizations	should	be	celebrating	failure	that	happened	as	result	of	novel	creation	because	not	fearing	failure	brings	about	creativity
therefore	organizations	will	have	to	think	of	ways	to	manage	failure	and	many	of	them	turn	to	spectrum	of	the	reason	for	failure	as	guideline	to	manage	various	cases	of	failure	with	different	solutions
exploit	and	explore	the	duo	cores	of	organizations	mr	rawit	perceives	creative	innovation	which	is	responsible	for	the	experimental	team	as	being	messy	and	haphazard	explore	unlike	business	that	is	already	stable	and	gaining	profits	exploit
thus	the	evaluation	of	explore	would	be	different	from	that	of	exploit	which	efficiency	can	be	tested
explore	then	will	be	evaluated	on	object	key	results	okr
the	company	nowadays	should	have	these	forms	of	business	as	cores	to	drive	the	organizations
does	the	idea	work
according	to	the	statistic	of	the	new	product	launch	is	not	successful
the	reason	is	that	majority	of	the	companies	are	in	rush	to	launch	the	new	product	without	knowing	their	consumers	well
the	question	that	has	to	be	answered	is	whether	the	product	is	desired	in	the	market	or	we	just	want	to	produce
if	the	answer	is	the	latter	it	is	going	to	be	risky	as	our	needs	do	not	match	our	customers	needs
therefore	we	have	to	ensure	that	the	idea	will	work	before	creating	new	products
rules	for	creating	innovation	the	question	earlier	brings	about	these	rules	of	test	that	mr	rawit	recommends	as	checklist	for	entrepreneurs	to	create	innovation
solutions	to	help	manage	professional	and	complete	business
new	digital	banking	platform	to	enhance	the	good	financial	experience	for	business	customers
in	any	tourist	attraction	we	always	see	foreigners	with	big	backpacks	on	their	backs	chilling	among	locals
in	the	business	sphere	this	group	of	travelers	is	called	backpackers
backpackers	are	mostly	teenage	foreigners	with	different	traveling	lifestyles	compared	to	other	groups
one	of	their	differences	is	the	accommodation	they	mainly	choose	and	they	call	it	hostel
in	the	dots	hotel	game	changer	by	scb	sme	miss	phen	jarupa	sunthornpagasit	ceo	of	bed	station	hostel	talks	about	her	road	to	success	in	hostel	business
what	is	hostel
the	hostel	is	type	of	accommodation	similar	to	dormitory
in	room	there	consists	of	several	bunk	beds	with	about	beds	in	total
the	price	is	calculated	per	bed
the	toilets	and	showers	are	public	with	basic	facilities
it	is	more	of	self	service	system	that	it	is	more	popular	among	backpackers	as	more	cost	saving	choice
also	many	hostels	are	renovated	from	shophouses
so	it	seems	that	anyone	could	open	hostel	turning	hostel	into	popular	business	in	the	traveling	industry
it	seems	like	an	easy	business	to	start	but	it	is	not	easy	to	make	it	successful
miss	phen	jarupa	ph	and	ceo	shared	about	her	beginning	in	hostel	business	about	years	ago
originally	her	family	has	condominium	business	and	they	will	only	receive	an	income	when	they	hand	the	room	over	to	the	tenants
so	she	wants	to	look	for	business	that	cash	will	flow	in	every	day
moreover	the	hostel	was	not	popular	then	and	most	hostels	were	not	located	near	underground	stations
miss	phen	thus	sees	chance	to	open	hostel	in	location	that	can	easily	access	the	train	stations	and	the	heart	of	the	town	like	siam	square
that	is	how	bed	station	project	comes	about
bed	station	hostel	house	for	backpackers	after	looking	for	shophouses	along	train	tracks	for	months	building	near	bts	ratchathewi	is	chosen
miss	phen	renovated	story	shophouse	into	home	for	travelers
she	sets	concept	that	these	beds	will	have	to	be	the	best	place	to	rest	and	home	in	bangkok	for	backpackers
she	increases	privacy	and	comfort	for	guests	more	than	other	hostels	could	offer	by	adding	curtains	for	every	bed	and	equipping	every	bed	with	lockers	for	guests	to	store	their	phones	or	wallets
apart	from	that	she	puts	more	lockers	outside	the	room	for	guests	to	store	their	belongings	as	well	as	installs	large	mirror	in	the	bathrooms	for	ladies	to	groom	up
more	importantly	miss	phen	organizes	events	and	activities	for	any	guest	who	is	interested	such	as	thai	food	cooking	class	thai	language	class	and	tour	to	taling	chan	floating	market	or	bang	krachao	floating	market
with	friendly	and	outgoing	behavior	of	foreigners	guests	are	able	to	make	new	companions
even	if	they	are	away	from	home	they	can	still	feel	the	warmth	as	if	bed	station	is	their	home	in	bangkok
bed	one	block	hostel	another	branch	for	asian	travellers	from	the	tremendous	success	of	bed	station	with	booking	rate	of	no	less	than	miss	phen	found	out	that	there	is	difference	in	characters	of	western	and	asian	travelers
while	american	and	european	travelers	love	partying	doing	activities	and	chatting	with	the	staff	asian	travelers	dislike	talking	to	strangers	and	only	contact	staff	as	much	as	necessary
this	causes	negative	review	for	example	asian	guests	would	complain	that	western	guests	are	noisy
on	the	other	hand	western	guests	feel	that	asian	guests	habit	of	not	mingle	with	strangers	results	in	an	unfriendly	atmosphere
this	is	how	bed	one	block	hostel	with	beds	and	situated	in	the	area	nearby	bed	station	comes	about
miss	phen	has	an	idea	to	open	this	hostel	and	mainly	target	asian	travelers
this	receives	highly	positive	feedbacks	because	it	is	hostel	that	understands	the	nature	of	asian
the	clean	design	of	an	interior	makes	every	corner	of	this	hostel	photo	spot	which	suits	an	activity	that	asian	commonly	does	which	is	taking	photo	or	selfie
there	is	stairway	leads	up	to	the	top	of	the	bunk	bed	without	need	to	climb	which	asian	guests	are	very	fond	of
the	size	of	the	bed	will	also	be	slightly	smaller	to	suit	the	physical	builds	of	asians
but	the	size	of	the	lockers	is	bigger	as	asian	guests	usually	carry	luggage
bed	one	block	hostel	does	not	need	to	organize	any	activity	because	the	behavioral	pattern	of	asian	guests	is	to	go	out	in	the	morning	and	come	back	at	night	and	thus	the	staff	at	the	counter	will	only	be	on	duty	for	to	forward	to	khaosan	road	the	centre	of	hostels	miss	phen	told	us	that	there	are	questions	she	often	asked	by	the	western	guests	where	is	the	gym
is	there	pool
how	to	get	to	khaosan	road
miss	phen	thus	gets	an	idea	to	open	hostel	that	these	demands	can	be	met	which	is	bed	station	hostel	khaosan
the	third	branch	is	located	on	pattani	road	and	it	only	takes	minutes	by	foot	to	get	to	khaosan	road	destination	of	backpackers	from	all	over	the	world
this	is	newly	built	hostel	with	medium	size	gym	and	pool	as	well	as	bar	that	satisfies	the	lifestyle	of	western	guests	lot
key	to	success	of	bed	station	from	her	family	background	as	property	business	owner	miss	phen	feels	that	location	is	the	most	important	factor	that	determines	the	success	of	the	hostel	business
this	can	be	seen	from	the	first	branch	of	bed	station	hostel	in	ratchathewi	which	is	opened	in	convenient	location	near	the	train	station	and	siam	square
and	the	third	branch	bed	station	hostel	khaosan	is	nearby	khaosan	road	that	foreign	guests	would	love	to	visit
this	makes	the	guests	always	give	full	review	score	for	the	hostel	on	location
staff	is	also	equally	important	especially	when	hostel	has	to	establish	welcoming	and	friendly	atmosphere	for	the	guests	to	feel	at	ease
human	touches	like	small	conversation	show	care	to	guests	and	make	them	want	to	return	again
and	because	of	the	staff	team	of	bed	station	hostel	are	like	family	they	contribute	to	more	than	of	the	percentage	returning	customer	of	the	hostel
in	terms	of	management	strategy	due	to	the	different	target	groups	different	branches	will	have	to	fight	in	different	markets
in	the	first	phase	of	bed	station	hostel	in	ratchathewi	the	target	customers	are	western	backpackers	and	so	it	will	be	opened	for	booking	on	hostelworld	com	which	is	popular	ota	among	backpackers
on	the	other	hand	bed	one	block	aims	to	triumph	the	asian	guests	market	so	the	booking	is	opened	on	booking	com	agoda	or	traveloka	that	are	popular	among	asian	travelers
in	terms	of	resource	management	as	bed	station	hostel	ratchathewi	and	bed	one	block	hostel	are	not	far	from	each	other	these	branches	share	cleaners	and	staff
as	for	bed	station	hostel	ratchathewi	and	khaosan	are	of	the	same	brand	so	they	are	promoted	through	the	same	instagram	account	with	different	hashtags
for	the	question	of	whether	bed	station	hostel	ratchathewi	and	khaosan	will	fight	with	each	other	for	the	same	market	shares	fear	not	miss	phen	clearly	separates	these	two
ratchathewi	branch	will	give	out	warmth	vibes	with	soft	music	playing	and	the	presence	of	chubby	cat	while	the	khaosan	branch	will	give	party	vibe	with	bikini	and	pool	party
guests	can	then	choose	the	lodge	of	their	own	liking
amidst	the	blooming	of	hostel	business	leading	hostels	to	go	on	fierce	fight	with	one	another
but	the	reason	that	bed	station	hostel	can	still	strive	is	the	passion	and	care	that	miss	phen	gives	to	her	business	and	guests
at	the	beginning	of	building	up	the	hostel	miss	phen	spent	hours	per	day	and	days	per	week	on	her	hostel
she	chats	and	kept	all	guests	in	touch
she	took	care	of	their	stay	and	gave	importance	to	all	the	comments	received
this	allows	her	to	know	whatever	that	has	been	going	on	in	her	hostel	and	she	also	answered	all	questions	by	herself
the	heart	and	soul	that	she	puts	in	makes	these	bed	station	hostels	true	home	for	travelers
enhancing	business	services	to	more	advanced	than	ever	new	digital	banking	platform	for	enhancing	the	good	financial	experience	for	business	customers
marking	its	first	anniversary	bangkok	based	small	player	food	delivery	application	robinhood	has	received	very	warm	response	from	restaurants	and	app	users
the	app	is	growing	exponentially	in	every	aspect	with	the	platform	having	over	million	registered	users	some	restaurants	and	riders
robinhood	is	set	to	continue	its	determination	to	support	local	business	operators	in	three	non	food	business	sectors	an	online	travel	agent	ota	service	covering	accommodation	reservations	air	tickets	travel	activities	and	car	rental	and	insurance	grocery	shopping	service	and	non	food	delivery	service
mr	thana	thienachariya	board	chairman	and	mr	srihanath	lamsam	managing	director	at	robinhood	operator	purple	ventures	recently	revealed	the	apps	vision	of	becoming	regional	player	as	thai	super	app	by	five	memorable	moments	in	establishing	the	robinhood	identity	fall	toddle	crawl	walk	run	looking	at	robinhood	as	small	child	since	its	launch	on	october	shows	it	passing	through	the	development	stages	of	toddling	falling	rising	up	walking	and	now	running	on	its	first	anniversary
khun	thana	recaptured	five	moments	of	becoming	the	robinhood	of	today
idea	moment	the	robinhood	application	is	the	brainchild	of	mr	arthid	nanthawithaya	scb	chief	executive	officer	and	chairman	of	the	executive	committee
mr	arthid	first	conceived	the	idea	when	he	ordered	food	via	food	delivery	app	on	april	during	the	first	covid	lockdown
he	wanted	to	help	business	operators	affected	by	the	crisis	whereas	support	during	that	time	was	mostly	through	donations
khun	thana	recalled	we	couldnt	figure	out	how	to	compete	with	the	apps	developed	by	big	international	players	available	in	the	market	back	then	with	our	having	only	million	baht	in	the	capital	while	others	had	billions	nevertheless	he	decided	to	give	food	delivery	app	shot
this	moment	marked	the	birth	of	the	robinhood	application
fail	test	moment	the	plan	was	to	launch	the	robinhood	application	on	september	just	before	the	planned	launch	the	ceo	asked	the	app	development	team	whether	the	app	could	handle	up	to	transactions	day
according	to	the	teams	stress	test	the	answer	was	yes
but	the	ceo	decided	to	make	sure	by	running	simulation	test	with	real	orders	and	real	deliveries
so	some	branch	staff	members	were	enlisted	to	place	their	orders	via	the	app	during	peak	hours	between	am	pm	resulting	in	an	immediate	app	crash
this	made	us	realize	that	we	were	still	amateurs	so	we	had	to	postpone	the	launch	to	october	we	then	continued	to	test	the	app	with	real	orders	until	it	was	capable	of	handling	customers
this	goal	was	soon	met	and	on	the	revised	launch	date	the	app	ran	smoothly	khun	thana	said
robinhood	hail	mary	fried	egg	moment	during	the	apps	early	phase	there	were	some	orders	day
the	number	jumped	to	orders	by	june	key	turning	point	was	the	major	lockdown	starting	around	july	the	ceo	saw	it	as	critical	moment	to	save	business	operators	hit	severely	by	the	lockdown
apart	from	being	big	impact	csr	campaign	it	was	an	opportunity	for	exponential	growth
the	robinhood	app	then	offered	free	delivery	promotion	resulting	in	daily	orders	skyrocketing	to	despite	few	system	glitches	during	the	start	in	span	of	days	the	team	finally	managed	to	expand	the	systems	capability	to	handle	times	more	orders
the	ceo	saw	that	if	we	didnt	help	business	operators	at	that	moment	then	when
moreover	the	fried	egg	moment	was	when	there	was	an	order	for	baht	fried	egg	for	km	distance
this	showed	us	that	the	robinhood	app	developed	from	wish	to	help	people	had	people	who	empathized	with	us
nice	thing	about	the	robinhood	app	is	that	all	concerned	parties	customers	eateries	and	riders	supported	us	while	the	platform	began	to	receive	recognition	from	small	to	medium	moment	next	was	test	of	the	robinhood	apps	organic	growth
after	the	promotion	ended	would	the	number	of	daily	orders	drop	to	the	level	that	it	had	prior	to	the	promotion
happily	even	after	the	promotion	ended	the	number	of	orders	remained	at	around	orders	day	in	august
thanks	to	this	moment	robinhood	has	now	become	medium	sized	platform	ranked	no
or	no
in	bangkok	and	vicinity	with	some	million	registered	users	and	around	active	users	each	day
this	demonstrated	steady	growth	and	was	the	moment	we	began	to	walk	more	steadily	spring	board	moment	viewing	that	progress	the	ceo	saw	the	robinhood	apps	potential	as	solid	customer	base	with	high	spending	power	and	decided	to	grow	it	to	super	app
with	capital	granted	by	the	executive	committee	we	will	grow	robinhood	to	super	app	status	in	the	next	two	years
we	expect	to	be	up	and	running	by	next	year	khun	thana	remarked
five	lessons	learned	through	robinhoods	journey	of	falling	rising	learning	khun	thana	talked	about	what	the	team	has	learned	over	the	past	days
robinhood	customer	other	than	the	food	and	beverage	sector	the	travel	and	hospitality	service	sector	is	the	largest	sme	sector	we	wish	to	help
the	purchasing	power	of	robinhood	app	users	is	very	high
the	majority	of	the	apps	strong	customer	base	are	scb	credit	card	customers	and	the	middle	class	in	bangkok	and	vicinity
this	has	led	to	an	idea	to	further	develop	robinhood	as	super	app	offering	more	services	including	travel	service	as	we	expect	increased	travel	demand	next	year
platform	of	kindness	there	have	always	been	supporters	by	our	side	because	the	robinhood	app	started	with	the	good	intention	of	helping	others
restaurants	riders	and	customers	have	always	protected	the	robinhood	app	because	everyone	feels	our	sincerity
khun	thana	noted	many	customers	use	our	app	because	they	feel	they	can	help	riders	and	restaurants	avoid	gross	profit	gp	charges
apart	from	increased	purchasing	power	think	theres	an	energy	of	doing	good	things	in	the	background	its	always	fun	to	do	the	impossible	having	learned	so	many	things	the	team	behind	the	robinhood	app	is	confident	in	making	the	impossible	possible
the	next	goal	of	becoming	regional	player	may	seem	unlikely	for	local	platform	but	it	is	entirely	possible
olympic	standard	with	businesses	worldwide	having	presence	in	thailand	key	lesson	learned	for	business	operators	is	that	local	standards	are	no	longer	the	minimum	requirement	for	your	product	service	or	platform	development
when	others	are	olympic	players	you	cannot	compete	against	them	with	sea	game	standards
for	everything	we	do	we	always	aim	for	olympic	standards
our	mindset	our	tests	our	practices	and	the	customer	experience	must	all	meet	olympic	standards
underdog	way	in	setting	goal	for	product	and	service	development	to	olympic	standards	for	an	underdog	in	terms	of	funding	team	and	scale	an	important	thing	is	to	do	it	differently
khun	thana	provided	an	example	you	need	to	find	way	to	differentiate	yourself	from	the	competition
for	example	others	charge	gp	fees	but	we	dont
and	we	avoid	areas	already	dominated	by	other	players
this	is	how	we	fight	as	an	underdog	to	survive	with	the	five	lessons	and	the	five	moments	robinhood	aspires	to	be	thai	platform	in	battlefield	full	of	international	platforms
we	are	ready	to	grow	along	with	thai	society	and	compete	as	thai	platform	in	the	regional	arena	khun	thana	said
robinhoods	memorable	numbers	in	the	first	year	on	its	first	anniversary	robinhood	has	exponentially	grown	in	every	aspect
what	are	some	statistics	to	remember
mr	srihanath	lamsam	purple	ventures	managing	director	revealed	the	top	five	figures	from	its	data	house
the	top	five	selling	items	are	noodles	bubble	milk	tea	pad	krapao	salmon	and	coffee
the	top	five	areas	by	the	number	of	orders	are	chatuchak	huay	khwang	bang	kapi	lat	prao	and	saima
the	top	five	sellers	are	all	about	eat	hear	hai	nong	rim	khlong	ob	aroi	town	in	town	and	gu	salmon
amid	the	covid	crisis	robinhood	has	played	role	in	helping	thais	weather	hardships	together
thanks	to	impressive	moments	from	the	free	delivery	campaign	the	number	of	orders	has	jumped	by	times	along	with	positive	social	media	buzz	about	job	opportunities	for	riders	who	connect	restaurants	and	customers	through	food	delivery
it	has	also	created	an	ecosystem	of	mutual	support	with	restaurants	providing	riders	with	seating	and	drinks	while	they	wait	for	orders	to	be	processed
riders	in	turn	helping	restaurants	prepare	orders
and	some	customers	have	even	ordered	extra	food	for	riders
khun	srihanath	noted	that	the	free	delivery	campaign	began	with	an	initial	intention	to	help	people	during	the	covid	lockdown	but	it	turned	out	that	robinhood	grew	exponentially	in	just	four	weeks
growth	numbers	following	the	campaign	went	from	to	riders	from	to	eateries	from	million	to	million	customers	and	from	to	orders	day
robinhoods	statistics	over	the	past	year	reflect	its	growth	from	its	first	step	until	now
daily	orders	have	skyrocketed	by	with	million	users	some	billion	baht	in	sales	riders	eateries	and	some	service	hours
the	total	delivery	distance	is	equivalent	to	trips	between	the	earth	and	the	moon
the	heaviest	order	weight	was	kilograms	of	khiriwong	mangosteens	and	the	top	user	in	terms	of	order	quantity	placed	orders
robinhoods	next	step	as	for	the	next	step	khun	srihanath	noted	that	robinhood	will	continue	its	aspiration	to	help	local	business	operators	with	wider	range	of	services
beyond	food	delivery	service	the	platform	is	set	to	expand	to	three	new	non	food	businesses
first	acting	as	an	online	travel	agent	ota	with	bookings	for	hotels	air	tickets	travel	activities	car	rentals	and	travel	insurance	as	an	option	for	smes	to	save	costs	on	ota	commissions	and	fees
second	grocery	shopping	service	to	connect	business	operators	to	robinhood	customers	with	purchasing	power	and	ready	to	shop	for	quality	products
third	an	on	demand	express	parcel	delivery	service	to	cater	to	the	fast	growing	commerce	sector
strategy	paving	the	way	to	becoming	thai	super	app	every	app	player	wants	to	become	super	app
what	is	robinhoods	strategy	for	its	next	step	to	achieve	that	position	in	this	game
khun	srihanath	stated	that	in	robinhood	will	expand	its	availability	to	other	provinces	starting	with	three	popular	travel	destinations	chiang	mai	phuket	and	chon	buri
these	three	pilot	provinces	were	chosen	based	on	their	potential	and	high	demand	for	food	delivery	services
in	parallel	there	will	be	quality	enhancement	of	eateries	and	riders	customer	experience	enhancement	with	more	features	matching	their	needs	and	merchant	support	for	customer	caring	eateries
furthermore	robinhood	is	set	to	benefit	from	synergy	with	scbx	companies	such	as	auto	card	data	scb	tech	in	terms	of	customer	acquisition	and	data	leveraging	for	developing	lending	opportunities	and	other	financial	products	and	services	advertising	and	promotional	campaigns	for	the	maximum	benefit	of	merchants	and	customers
in	the	pipeline	is	fund	raising	plan	to	boost	the	platforms	capabilities	and	service	development	paving	its	way	to	fully	becoming	thai	super	app	ready	for	competition	as	regional	player
in	conclusion	over	the	past	days	robinhood	has	reached	milestone	proving	its	potential	and	goodwill	in	creating	an	ecosystem	that	is	particularly	beneficial	for	small	players	allowing	them	to	compete	freely	in	online	business	on	level	playing	field	without	the	pain	of	gp	charges

increase	business	capability	mr	jareeporn	jarukornsakul	chairman	of	the	board	of	directors	and	group	ceo	of	wha	corporation	public	company	limited	shared	their	experiences	with	the	participants	of	mission	the	boot	camp	of	advanced	corporate	transformation	class	as	follows	the	future	is	faster	than	you	think	in	an	era	where	technology	is	growing	by	leaps	and	bounds	causing	rapid	change	being	able	to	predict	is	therefore	key	factor	for	success
khun	jareeporn	said	that	if	anyone	sees	trend	they	see	an	opportunity
in	planning	and	creating	new	business	model	for	the	businesspeople	need	to	look	to	the	future
must	think	in	advance	from	the	experience	of	doing	business	in	jareeporn	for	more	than	years	never	feel	comfortable	each	year	there	will	be	test	all	the	time
how	to	win	in	the	arena	of	change
since	technology	is	changing	very	fast
when	looking	back	at	our	house	in	addition	to	not	keeping	up	with	technology	the	regulator	is	still	somewhat	lagging
if	it	is	foreign	country	it	will	be	released	first	and	the	regulator	will	watch	closely
if	not	it	will	hit	the	brakes
if	yes	then	let	go
but	in	thailand	we	have	lot	of	prohibitions	to	get	stuck
so	nothing	new	will	happen

and	prolonged	geopolitical	tensions	will	inevitably	affect	the	global	trade	system
at	the	same	time	higher	inflation	around	the	world	is	something	that	businesses	must	pay	special	attention	to	khun	jareeporn	said	re	opening	around	the	world	opening	the	city	after	covid	causing	the	recovery	of	tourism	the	tourism	business	will	be	active	again
rising	geopolitical	tensions	geopolitical	conflicts	will	affect	international	trade
and	the	russo	ukrainian	war	how	will	it	be
khun	jareeporn	views	that	conflicts	have	been	around	for	long	time	it	common	thing	that	happens	repeatedly	of	course	affecting	the	world
but	for	thailand	not	much	because	thailand	is	neutral
and	thailand	will	have	opportunities	from	export	businesses	such	as	food	due	to	the	depreciation	of	the	baht
redefining	the	supply	chain	from	the	covid	crisis	new	sources	of	supply	chain	have	been	found
to	spread	the	risk	if	crisis	arises	will	not	affect	the	supply	chain	system	in	the	future	pivot	to	indo	pacific	thailands	advantages	the	united	states	has	placed	greater	emphasis	on	the	indo	pacific	region
this	will	benefit	thailand	because	thailand	is	in	the	center	of	southeast	asia	which	is	considered	strategic	location	for	being	production	and	export	base	in	this	region
inflation	and	global	debt	crisis	causing	inflation	around	the	world	as	result	interest	rates	have	been	raised	in	many	countries
and	could	lead	to	an	economic	recession
when	the	situation	is	like	this	businesses	must	be	prepared	to	deal	with	rising	interest	rates
by	preparing	liquidity	for	both	short	and	long	term	green	planet	sustainable	business	development	or	esg	environment	social	governance	is	something	that	businesses	must	focus	on
because	it	helps	build	credibility	to	the	business	in	the	future	driving	the	future	with	electric	vehicles	electric	cars	will	be	future	economic	driver
by	of	all	cars	produced	in	thailand	will	be	electric	vehicles	and	mr	jareeporn	views	that	thailand	will	become	hub	for	right	hand	drive	electric	vehicles	in	the	future

digital	innovation	transformation	khun	jareeporn	shared	her	experience	in	doing	digital	transformation	of	wha	group	that	in	he	started	doing	it	even	though	at	that	time	the	company	was	not	ready
but	to	wait	for	everything	to	be	ready	it	may	be	too	late
therefore	we	started	doing	digital	innovation	first
the	method	was	to	bring	new	generations	into	the	company
while	the	older	generation	will	organize	training	for	everyone	to	realize	that	the	organization	needs	to	be	transformed	in	digital	transformation	has	begun
according	to	survey	of	corporate	executives	in	thailand	think	they	must	but	most	tend	to	hire	consultants	to	do	it
but	in	the	view	of	khun	jareeporn	see	that	the	ceo	must	know	what	the	company	should	transform	what	should	the	business	model	be
not	for	consultant	to	tell
for	consultants	it	should	help	in	things	that	we	don	know	such	as	ai
when	wha	started	doing	that	there	was	no	tech	team	at	all
the	approach	was	to	team	up	with	well	established	tech	company
which	khun	jareeporn	sees	that	it	better	than	hiring	new	people	to	work
because	it	may	not	be	compatible	with	the	culture	of	the	organization
the	misconception	about	digital	transformation	is	that	strategy	is	what	makes	it	successful
but	in	fact	what	makes	it	successful	is	the	ability	to	act
khun	jareeporn	said	that	digitalization	it	the	first	mission
of	organizations	to	do	but	only	organizations	are	successful	according	to	deloitte	digital	transformation	survey	are	successful	in	improving	business	performance	and	sustaining	long	term	performance
achieved	improvements	in	business	performance	but	failing	to	sustainably	improve	performance	over	the	long	term	were	relatively	successful	in	improving	performance	and	were	unsuccessful	in	improving	performance
what	are	the	factors	that	make	digital	transformation	successful
digital	strategy	and	targets	have	clear	roadmap	and	measurable	kpis
organizational	structure	for	digital	transformation	optimize	the	structure	don	do	it	like	silo
pilot	projects	that	use	test	and	learn	approach	learn	from	mistakes	talent	and	capabilities	attract	new	talent	and	build	up	the	old
ecosystem	to	create	cooperation	between	each	other	such	as	joint	projects	investments	joint	ventures
culture	change	the	corporate	culture
promote	understanding	reward	or	create	role	model
khun	jareeporn	also	added	that	top	management	has	to	come	down	and	play
but	don	use	the	word	top	down	but	call	it	bash	dao
you	have	to	beat	people	to	understand	that	you	have	to	do	it	misconceptions	about	digital	transformation	another	point	is	that	it	not	separate	project	but	something	that	all	departments	in	the	organization	must	do	together
another	thing	is	that	it	about	technology
but	in	fact	also	including	people	corporate	culture	and	ecosystem	as	well
choose	to	do	only	the	critical	parts	before	doing	all	of	them
wha	group	path	with	technology	empowerment	strategy	wha	group	was	established	in	and	consists	of	main	businesses	logistics	wha	corporation	public	company	limited	industrial	development	wha	industrial	company	development	public	company	limited	utilities	and	energy	wha	utilities	and	power	public	company	limited	and	digital	platform	wha	info	nit	co	ltd	the	wha	group	has	laid	out	strategies	to	drive	the	organization	with	innovation	as	follows	digital	transformation	use	technology	to	enhance	your	business	increase	operational	efficiency	in	innovative	workplace	an	innovative	organization	generate	revenue	from	new	products	and	services	with	innovations	based	on	customer	demand	data	driven	organization	use	data	to	drive	organizations	increase	competitive	advantage	creating	innovations	from	data	turning	to	digital	company	becoming	fully	digital	company
the	wha	group	concept	of	digital	innovation	and	digital	transformation	is	to	bring	technology	and	innovation	deeply	rooted	within	the	wha	group	business
as	for	digital	innovation	it	starts	with	initiating	new	products	and	services	with	innovations	that	respond	to	the	needs	of	customers	and	business	partners
while	doing	digital	transformation	starting	from	the	back	of	the	house	by	providing	the	technology	infrastructure	to	be	ready	for	change	and	new	technologies	to	increase	efficiency	prevent	and	reduce	the	impact	of	interruptions	increase	productivity	reduce	in	addition	wha	innovation	bootcamp	is	organized	within	the	organization	to	increase	the	potential	of	people	in	the	organization	develop	innovation	project	with	outside	experts	to	advise
find	new	initiatives	to	solve	problems	in	the	organization
that	can	be	developed	and	further	developed	into	new	business	even	though	the	technology	storm	is	raging	relentlessly	but	if	the	organization	has	prepared	the	digital	transformation	weapon	ready	it	will	be	able	to	survive
stand	firm	competitive	potential	in	an	era	where	nothing	is	true	and	certain	anymore	before	we	parted	khun	jareeporn	has	concluded	that	do	not	be	afraid	of	change
because	people	have	to	live	with	change	do	not	be	afraid	of	ignorance	because	we	have	to	learn	all	the	time	source	mission	the	boot	camp	of	advanced	corporate	transformation	class	by	khun	jareeporn	jarukornsakul	chairman	of	the	board	of	directors	and	group	chief	executive	officer	of	wlingha	corporation	public	company	limited	on	june	at	the	siam	commercial	bank	headquarters
digital	transformation	exponential	growth
how	to	empower	sme	business	competition	in	the	digital	era	to	enhance	strength	sustainability	and	exponential	growth
taking	innovation	to	change	the	organization	is	secret	weapon	that	can	bring	thai	smes	to	leap	jump
siam	commercial	bank	incorporated	with	national	innovation	agency	nia	arranged	the	nia	scb	innovation	based	enterprise	ibe	training	course	for	sme	entrepreneurs	in	both	production	and	service	business	to	empower	the	competition	and	build	network	to	drive	the	economics	nationwide
dr	suriya	the	course	director	presented	the	framework	to	develop	innovation	as	major	principle	to	improve	and	solve	sme	problems
uphold	innovation	to	drive	business	dr	suriya	said	that	innovation	is	new	invention	or	changing	from	the	original
therefore	successful	innovation	will	create	value	for	both	customers	and	businesses
innovation	consists	of	functions	new	ideas	technology	and	product	and	is	divided	into	different	categories	new	products	new	services	new	processes	and	new	business	models	such	as	food	ordering	platforms	etc
the	concept	of	innovation	to	solve	problems	are	classified	as	problem	domain	customer	problems	or	market	demand	and	solution	domain	problem	solutions	which	include	levels	besides	smes	is	looking	for	space	for	areas	of	improvement	in	the	business	for	example	products	services	process	customer
after	that	considering	if	the	outcome	is	really	in	line	with	customer	insight	which	is	called	job	to	be	done
when	customer	insight	is	clarified	find	out	if	your	existing	products	and	services	provide	benefits	or	features	that	can	solve	customer	challenges
if	not	pick	some	features	from	old	products	and	make	new	improvements	or	check	competitors	features	and	then	improve	your	products
all	those	processes	are	called	innovation
here	are	the	samples	of	job	to	be	done
in	creating	innovation	one	must	understand	the	functions	of	products	and	services	which	can	be	divided	into	aspects	functional	performance	and	emotional	performance
therefore	if	selling	functional	products	such	as	tools	industrial	products	it	must	focus	on	the	application	or	service	by	the	features	of	the	service	that	the	customer	needs	such	as	speed	accuracy	accuracy	easy	problem	solving
while	selling	emotional	items	such	as	fashion	items	cosmetics	and	accessories	must	focus	primarily	on	emotional
for	example	famous	brands	of	coffee	are	more	emotional	than	they	are	functional	so	they	can	be	sold	at	higher	price	than	others
if	you	need	to	find	areas	of	improvement	from	old	products	or	services	its	important	to	explore	an	opportunity	and	how	to	create	customer	satisfaction
the	questions	to	be	used	in	the	research	comprise	issues	what	are	the	things	about	products	or	services	that	matter	most	to	you
how	would	you	rate	your	satisfaction	with	the	current	products	or	services
after	receiving	the	results	youll	calculate	to	find	an	opportunity	and	satisfaction
opportunity	important	max	importance	satisfaction	the	formula	will	help	to	find	an	opportunity	grid	by	looking	for	connection	between	importance	and	customer	satisfaction
according	to	the	opportunity	grid	table	analyze	what	is	the	opportunity	to	create	an	innovation
for	example	what	is	important	in	the	eyes	of	customers	but	gain	little	satisfaction	or	what	makes	high	satisfaction	but	is	not	significant	in	the	eyes	of	customers	because	theyre	not	able	to	reach	your	service
if	you	see	the	opportunity	from	those	issues	then	turn	them	to	innovation
coin	has	sides	as	well	as	the	business	dr	suriya	said	that	the	nature	of	business	consists	of	sides	which	are	improve	existing	business	to	grow	profit	or	make	it	better	by	sorting	out	something	and	getting	rid	of	something	and	build	the	future	business	to	emphasize	growth	and	make	difference
for	example	kodak	who	used	to	produce	photographic	film	and	has	later	shifted	to	produce	digital	camera	as	the	future	business
models	to	improve	the	business	tool	called	sipoc	map	is	introduced	to	improve	the	business	in	order	to	create	an	innovation
this	map	helps	opening	broad	picture	of	the	business	and	processes	so	that	smes	can	find	an	opportunity	to	solve	problems	and	drive	innovation	at	the	end
the	advantages	of	sipoc	map	are	see	the	broad	view	of	all	business	processes	be	able	to	identify	customer	needs	in	each	process	and	how	customers	get	outcomes	be	able	to	identify	the	suppliers	of	manufacturing	process	be	able	to	point	out	demanding	gap	in	each	process	and	being	tool	to	monitor	customer	needs
by	bringing	innovation	to	solving	problems	businesses	must	fully	taking	innovation	to	be	adapted	as	solutions	for	business	problems	smes	have	to	understand	each	problem	and	customer	needs	thoroughly	in	order	to	obtain	new	opportunity	to	create	innovation	or	new	process	which	can	reduce	business	cost	and	grow	more	profit	including	adding	new	value	to	boost	sales	and	increase	more	marketing	opportunities	in	the	future

central	has	developed	its	own	platform	for	its	online	channel	and	collaborates	with	vietnam	number	one	social	media	partner	including	delivery	service
it	has	started	to	experiment	with	the	beep	beep	platform	as	click	collect	service	in	ho	chi	minh	city	by	setting	up	fulfillment	centers	where	customers	can	pick	up	items	at	their	convenience
this	channel	has	solved	pain	point	for	customers	who	shop	online	but	have	nobody	at	home	to	receive	shipments
how	similar	or	different	are	tops	markets	in	vietnam	vs	thailand
tops	market	in	vietnam	still	maintains	the	same	top	of	the	world	or	top	of	choice	concept	as	in	thailand	but	vietnamese	products	are	the	mainstay	with	mix	of	imported	products	based	on	popularity	surveys	of	vietnamese	and	foreign	customers
central	has	the	potential	to	bring	in	large	number	of	imported	products	allowing	it	to	offer	the	best	prices
apart	from	being	on	sale	in	tops	market	imported	products	are	also	sold	in	minigo	stores	to	cater	to	people	who	can	come	to	city	areas
besides	imported	products	tops	market	also	offers	organic	products
the	goal	is	to	allow	vietnamese	customers	to	eat	organic	fruits	and	vegetables	at	affordable	prices
central	has	adopted	customer	centric	approach	to	customize	meat	cheese	and	other	items	according	to	their	popularity	in	each	area
do	vietnamese	people	like	thai	products
based	on	khun	akesaks	direct	experience	talking	with	vietnamese	people	he	discovered	that	thai	products	both	food	and	appliances	were	preferred	among	vietnamese	people	due	to	superior	quality	and	taste	compared	to	vietnamese	products
and	prices	are	more	affordable	than	products	from	korea	or	japan
well	known	consumer	products	include	beverages	canned	fish	and	snacks	with	tastes	being	adjusted	to	suit	vietnamese	preferences
other	than	that	detergent	and	fabric	softeners	are	also	popular
cosmetics	products	are	also	of	good	quality	and	may	be	competitive	with	korean	or	japanese	brands
mr	chalermchai	cited	the	fact	that	despite	thais	and	vietnamese	having	similar	eating	habits	and	tastes	there	are	four	significant	challenges	that	investors	must	be	aware	of	in	order	to	succeed	business	operators	must	be	sincere
products	offered	must	be	of	good	quality
fresh	products	must	be	really	fresh	because	the	vietnamese	have	habit	of	touching	products	to	check	their	freshness
product	segmentation	must	be	clear
geographically	vietnam	is	divided	into	three	regions	north	central	and	south	vietnam
people	in	each	region	have	different	tastes	and	behaviors
therefore	it	is	important	to	understand	the	behavior	of	people	in	each	region
and	although	people	are	spending	more	value	for	money	is	still	priority	for	many
therefore	price	is	still	very	important	factor	in	the	vietnamese	market
vietnamese	customers	like	to	consider	products	carefully
services	should	communicate	the	quality	of	the	product	for	them	to	understand
vietnamese	people	value	children
activities	with	children	will	add	value	and	make	customers	love	our	products	even	more
recommendations	for	entrepreneurs	interested	in	vietnam	khun	chalermchai	also	shared	advice	for	entrepreneurs	preparing	to	invest	in	vietnam	as	follows	despite	vietnam	being	close	to	thailand	they	are	not	entirely	similar	to	thai	people
thinking	that	what	is	good	in	our	country	will	be	good	in	vietnam	is	mistake
we	should	learn	more	about	their	behavior
understand	geographical	characteristics	peoples	behaviors	and	their	needs
adjust	your	mindset
working	with	vietnamese	people	requires	different	type	of	communication
vietnamese	employees	have	high	self	confidence	and	are	concerned	about	their	dignity
companies	seeking	to	invest	must	be	patient
because	vietnam	has	high	potential	many	foreigners	are	seeking	to	invest	in	the	country	making	for	highly	competitive	market
companies	should	bring	management	team	from	thailand	to	ensure	that	performance	will	match	any	policy	laid	down
there	must	be	constant	updates	on	legal	matters
because	the	law	is	changing	regularly	investors	must	ensure	that	they	are	able	to	comply	with	all	the	laws	to	avoid	fines
investing	as	fdi	is	best	in	order	to	avoid	the	risk	of	irreconcilable	differences	with	business	partners	in	the	long	term

influencer	marketing	hotel	marketing	must	not	be	missed	in	the	new	normal	era
back	in	the	days	before	digital	flourished	hotel	advertising	had	the	use	of	newspapers
billboard	or	flyer
but	in	the	digital	age	and	especially	in	the	new	normal	era	where	consumer	behavior	has	changed	everyone	is	with	mobile	phones	everyone	uses	social	media
traditional	media	that	used	to	have	changed	itself	to	online
even	books	have	become	books
celebs	don	have	to	come	from	tv	anymore	because	now	everyone	can	create	popular	trend	for	themselves	through	social	media
an	online	presence	must	generate	content	to	be	conveyed
influencers	are	great	help	because	they	are	both	content	and	media	at	the	same	time
able	to	create	engaging	content	and	distribute	the	content	to	different	platforms
tellscore	has	provided	influencer	marketing	knowledge	to	push	hotels	to	bang
to	be	known	to	be	loved	and	to	increase	sales	for	hotels
the	content	will	be	covered	in	main	areas	why	does	business	use	influencer	marketing	what	types	of	influencer	influencer	new	normal	influencer	marketing	process	and	tracking	and	measurement
why	do	businesses	need	influencer	marketing
marketing	changes	influencer	marketing	is	the	most	common	form	of	marketing
which	really	influencers	have	been	around	for	long	time	such	as	friends	telling	friends	word	of	mouth
but	in	this	age	where	technology	has	come	into	play	instead	of	talking	person	to	person	one	can	post	on	social	media	once	and	reach	many	people	to	share	experiences
causing	influencer	marketing	to	grow	very	rapidly
of	buyers	are	influenced	by	influencer	purchasing	decisions
most	people	believe	their	friends	or	influencers	even	know	it	is	an	ad
but	sometimes	when	they	see	certain	content	too	often	even	though	they	know	that	it	is	an	advertisement	it	makes	them	want	to	try	it	themselves
the	health	of	brand	depends	largely	on	consumer	opinion
of	marketers	have	increased	their	influencer	budget	since	it	is	suggested	that	the	budget	for	influencers	use	should	be	of	the	total	digital	advertising	budget
an	influencer	is	to	let	third	party	tell	it	because	when	the	brand	owner	speaks	for	himself	people	won	trust	it	because	consumers	think	it	is	selling	things	to	themselves
therefore	giving	the	third	party	who	is	the	one	that	consumers	like	when	they	say	they	like	that	one	use	this	one	the	consumer	believes	that	the	item	must	be	good
what	kinds	of	influencers	are	there
today	everyone	can	be	an	influencer
even	in	the	hotel	business	no	one	knows	the	hotel	as	well	as	the	owner	himself
so	the	first	speaker	is	from	itself	first	such	as	living	posting	of	an	image	an	invitation	message	or	even	direct	inbox
therefore	the	main	medium	that	can	be	used	first	is	yourself	or	friends	relatives	or	employees	to	post	on	various	social	media	which	was	the	first	mouthpiece	that	could
look	at	yourself	at	the	people	around	you	who	are	ready	to	speak	before	hiring	an	expensive	influencer
influencer	type	the	hotels	can	choose	what	kind	of	information	they	want	to	present	and	select	fan	page	that	meets	the	needs	of	the	hotel
influencer	level	how	is	each	group	suitable	for	marketing
it	is	said	that	using	micro	influencer	is	worth	it	how	is	it	worth	it
one	kind	of	facebook	is	that	if	page	doesn	have	lot	of	followers	facebook	will	get	more	visibility	to	encourage	people	who	are	just	starting	out
but	when	it	is	page	that	has	lot	of	followers	in	the	millions	visibility	will	decline	because	facebook	wants	the	page	to	buy	ads	to	reach	more	people
there	are	some	interesting	numbers	for	example	if	million	people	are	following	your	chances	of	getting	visibility	are	just
but	while	micro	influencer	group	with	around	followers	has	chance	of	getting	visibility
therefore	if	you	want	to	invest	then	worth	spending	small	amount	of	money
but	lot	of	people	can	see	posts	to	begin	with	it	is	recommended	to	use	micro	influencer	group	would	be	suitable
the	future	of	marketing	will	be	geared	toward	one	to	one	communication
using	large	number	of	people	for	example	to	reach	large	group	of	people	micro	influencer	may	be	used	by	people	at	time	to	reach	large	numbers
plus	there	are	many	famous	institutions	talking	about	micro	influencers
forbes	for	example	says	this	is	golden	year	for	micro	influencers
and	people	like	products	from	content	creation	rather	than	advertising
therefore	advertising	alone	is	not	enough	and	micro	influencer	is	required
which	studies	have	shown	that	sales	are	doubled	compared	to	conventional	ads	and	repeat	purchases	are	more	than	other	channels
how	has	influencers	changed	in	the	new	normal
with	new	situations	there	are	changes	in	consumer	behavior	and	the	spread	of	covid
how	are	influencers
so	that	the	brand	can	adapt	and	apply	properly	move	line	get	new	goals	for	example	no	need	to	use	travel	line	to	review	hotels	only
see	if	there	are	any	groups	that	can	add	more	reviews	for	example	hotels	with	delicious	food	may	bring	food	line	to	review
or	hotel	suitable	for	families	it	uses	the	mother	and	childline	or	family	line	comes	to	review
you	must	try	to	look	more	broadly
let	look	at	group	of	customers	who	are	close	to	what	negative	impact	if	they	do	not	receive	our	services
how	should	you	adapt	in	tourism	business
first	you	need	to	understand	the	consumer	behavior	first
especially	during	this	period	that	no	foreign	tourists	must	turn	to	understand	thai	behavior
maybe	small	thing	little	thing	that	we	don	think	of	or	if	they	think	about	it	and	can	adjust	it	customers	will	be	in	with	us
for	example	upon	arriving	at	the	hotel	all	the	girls	like	to	put	on	makeup	before	going	to	take	beautiful	photos
but	hotels	often	use	yellow	lights	that	make	it	difficult	for	women	to	make	up
but	if	the	hotel	has	zone	in	the	room	for	makeup	women	will	feel	that	they	understand	us	which	is	sensitive	matter
or	is	there	socket	beside	the	bed
because	people	like	to	play	on	mobile	phones	before	bedtime
which	of	these	small	things	if	he	is	impressed	will	tell	others
post	telling	stories	writing	descriptions	and	posting	beautiful	pictures	without	having	an	influencer
whether	influencing	influencer	marketing	or	not	it	must	always	be	the	answer	that	hotels	must	answer	first
we	need	to	know	what	the	strength	of	our	hotel	is
why	tourists	need	to	use	the	service	buton	the	other	hand	if	the	customer	doesn	like	it	it	will	review	back	as	well	as	to	how	they	don	like	it
and	if	he	uses	an	influencer	he	will	be	voice	for	the	hotel	to	promote	in	the	strong	points
for	example	customers	like	to	take	pictures	on	social	media	they	must	have	lot	of	spots	to	take	pictures
or	if	you	are	family	customer	with	young	children	you	will	want	to	go	to	hotel	with	child	zone
or	group	of	cat	lovers	would	want	hotel	that	has	place	where	cats	can	sleep	comfortably	and	happily	hang	out	with	them
the	process	of	influencer	marketing	there	are	steps	in	total
set	the	target	audience	must	know	the	customer	who	are	the	customers
what	do	customers	want
why	does	he	have	to	use	our	service
how	is	the	purchase	of	products	and	services
for	example	do	they	first	look	at	friend	review
or	go	to	the	ota
for	some	operators	who	still	do	not	understand	customers	there	are	trends	of	thai	customers	that	the	hotel	should	know	as	follows	source	set	the	goals	you	want	most	smes	tend	to	want	multiple	items	but	they	should	choose	one	item	at	time	will	make	the	goal	clearer
there	are	goals	for	influencer	marketing	choose	communication	channel	the	first	thing	you	should	have	is	website	that	is	the	front	of	your	hotel	house	which	is	like	dam	that	holds	rainwater
by	influencer	or	various	social	media	is	water	blender	that	serves	to	call	rain	fetch	water	to	the	dam
so	there	must	be	three	things
first	you	need	website
next	are	various	social	media	channels
each	platform	has	its	own	strengths	and	methods	of	use
choose	an	influencer	there	are	methods	for	choosing	monitoring	and	measure	there	are	measures	to	create	awareness	engagement	and	lead	generation	influencer	marketing	is	another	powerful	marketing	tool	especially	for	the	hotel	business
able	to	create	both	awareness	engagement	and	lead	to	the	closure	of	the	sale	as	well
however	for	influencer	marketing	to	be	effective	you	must	know	your	customers	well
have	clear	goal	and	choose	an	influencer	that	suits	your	customer	group
the	goals	you	want	to	reach	and	the	available	budget	making	the	hotel	famous	increasing	sales	is	within	reach	source	scb	iep	bootcamp	training	program	the	hospitality	survival	phuket	elevating	business	services	to	the	next	level	new	digital	banking	platform	to	enhance	the	financial	experience	for	business	customers
vietnam	is	magical	word	attracting	investors	from	across	the	world	due	to	its	growing	economy	both	before	and	during	the	covid	pandemic
many	have	predicted	that	once	covid	has	petered	out	vietnam	will	continue	going	strong
dr	supaporn	sukmak	of	the	office	of	overseas	trade	promotion	in	ho	chi	minh	recently	shared	his	insights	on	business	opportunities	in	vietnam
every	positive	factor	can	be	spotted	in	vietnam
dr	supaporn	said	vietnam	has	been	able	to	cope	well	with	covid	as	result	of	its	strict	and	efficient	government	policy	in	implementing	regulations	and	measures	to	quickly	control	the	situation	such	as	imposing	lockdowns	suspending	international	flights	from	high	risk	countries	and	conducting	proactive	infection	testing
at	the	same	time	the	vietnamese	government	has	implemented	measured	stimulating	the	domestic	economy	by	injecting	money	through	three	important	mechanisms	comprising	interest	free	loans	for	the	household	economic	and	industrial	sectors	delaying	tax	payments	and	reducing	space	rental	fees	and	encouraging	the	financial	sector	to	support	vietnamese	entrepreneurs	such	as	by	reduction	exemption	of	interest	on	loans	and	service	fees	corporate	tax	reduction	and	placing	priority	on	local	sme	business	groups
the	stimulation	of	sme	businesses	will	help	boost	the	economy	in	the	country	supporting	the	well	being	of	its	people
apart	from	advantages	in	terms	of	the	number	and	structure	of	vietnams	younger	population	representing	both	the	labor	and	consumer	markets	the	countrys	regulations	and	investment	promotion	policies	under	free	trade	agreements	ftas	with	other	countries	especially	important	markets	such	as	the	european	union	uk	and	including	acep	agreements	with	ten	asean	countries	and	strategic	partners	have	offered	favorable	sentiments	for	its	economy
free	trade	agreements	of	this	nature	have	also	served	as	great	attraction	for	investors	helping	accelerate	its	economy	even	further
where	are	the	opportunities	for	thai	investors
thais	have	become	major	investors	in	vietnam	through	small	medium	and	large	projects
in	thai	investment	climbed	to	seventh	place	from	the	ninth	place	by	investments	in	various	forms	including	fdi	value	addition	for	projects	buying	stock	in	vietnamese	companies	and	other	means
dr	supaporn	has	noted	interesting	investment	opportunities	in	basic	utilities	and	infrastructure	projects	such	as	electricity	water	and	roads	because	vietnam	still	needs	investment	for	further	developing	the	country
currently	there	are	some	thai	companies	investing	in	renewable	energy	comprising	solar	wind	and	hydro	power	plants	as	well	as	pipe	laying	and	other	related	activities
at	the	same	time	the	younger	members	of	vietnams	growing	working	age	population	also	have	high	purchasing	power
their	social	characteristic	is	transitioning	into	urbanization	leading	to	change	in	consumer	behavior	and	opportunities	in	retail	and	wholesale	businesses	such	as	supermarkets
these	retailers	also	serve	as	distribution	channel	for	thai	products
vietnamese	consumers	tend	to	favor	thai	products	for	their	quality	and	reasonable	prices	offering	advantages	for	thai	consumer	products	and	trading	companies	importing	thai	products
the	manufacturing	industry	whether	packaging	or	service	sectors	related	to	manufacturing	software	and	manufacturing	management	offers	promising	hope	due	to	the	expansion	of	manufacturing
it	is	apparent	that	there	are	plenty	of	opportunities	for	thai	investors	in	vietnam	in	many	sectors
how	to	prepare	to	invest	in	vietnam
dr	supaporn	recommended	that	investors	should	carefully	study	investment	information	before	entering	the	market
thai	business	models	may	not	be	practical	as	the	vietnamese	market	has	its	own	unique	characteristics	amid	challenges	and	restrictions	especially	concerning	laws	and	regulations	that	are	being	updated	frequently	to	accommodate	various	sectors
therefore	it	is	important	to	do	your	homework	and	keep	up	to	date	on	information	in	order	to	identify	which	government	agencies	are	involved	in	your	business	and	other	related	factors	such	as	the	labor	market	minimum	wage	etc
the	offices	of	overseas	trade	promotion	in	hanoi	and	ho	chi	minh	city	have	various	information	supporting	investors	and	can	recommend	law	firms	to	offer	in	depth	advice
the	offices	also	offer	facilities	such	as	meeting	rooms	and	intelligence	data	and	can	help	with	financial	partners	and	sector	alliances

liquidity	and	cash	flow	are	the	arteries	keeping	business	running
the	scb	sme	survival	club	recently	held	discussion	with	sme	entrepreneurs	khun	chanisara	wongdeeprasit	managing	director	of	brunch	time	co	ltd	under	the	diamond	grains	brand	khun	silinlak	tulyanan	executive	chairman	of	food	equipment	co	ltd	and	the	scb	sme	team	to	help	smes	better	deal	with	current	business	challenges
business	overview	amid	the	new	wave	of	the	covid	situation	businesses	that	can	survive	are	mostly	those	offering	products	meeting	the	new	lifestyles	and	trending	hobbies	of	people	working	from	homes	such	as	surf	skateboards	plants	and	planting	equipment
small	businesses	can	easily	adjust	using	their	specialization	to	get	through	the	crisis	even	though	this	latest	covid	resurgence	has	been	more	severe	and	lasted	longer
as	for	diamond	grain	khun	chanisara	said	that	her	immediate	response	was	to	cut	unprofitable	sales	channels	and	reduce	operating	costs	such	as	discontinuing	diamond	grain	bowl	which	operated	shops	in	six	department	stores	that	are	currently	closed	under	lockdown	measures
some	former	store	and	event	staff	have	been	rotated	to	the	new	puckchumm	food	delivery	brand
previously	khun	chanisara	believed	that	business	risks	must	be	diversified
she	realized	that	her	company	can	depend	on	just	one	business
therefore	new	business	line	has	begun	using	the	existing	diamond	grain	base	of	two	million	customers	to	offer	solutions	to	customers	pain	points
differentiation	has	been	adopted	as	the	pillar	for	the	new	business
in	an	era	where	many	large	and	small	entrepreneurs	are	rushing	into	the	food	delivery	business	khun	chanisara	wants	her	brand	to	be	represented	as	truly	healthy	food
therefore	the	company	produces	vegetarian	food	products	that	are	not	oily	and	tasteless	supplemented	by	nutritious	cold	pressed	vegetable	juice	and	targeting	existing	diamond	grain	customers	who	are	ready	to	welcome	healthy	food
customers	are	aware	that	puckchumm	food	is	different	from	other	brands	because	it	is	both	tasty	and	healthy
due	to	our	strong	customer	base	we	don	have	to	spend	much	money	on	new	marketing	campaigns
and	having	realized	that	customers	may	not	be	excited	with	the	same	products	we	had	to	come	up	with	what	we	believe	they	want	said	khun	chanisara
as	distributor	of	food	processing	machines	such	as	shaved	ice	machines	for	bingsu	pork	slicing	machines	and	more	food	equipment	co	ltd	executive	chairman	khun	silinlak	said	that	prior	to	the	pandemic	her	company	was	in	safe	and	comfort	zone
after	the	last	round	of	covid	it	was	in	shock	for	while
with	many	of	its	customer	groups	experiencing	difficult	situations	such	as	factories	restaurants	and	hotels	the	company	developed	worst	case	scenario	plan	assessing	the	situation	as	if	it	were	unable	to	generate	any	revenue	at	all
having	analyzed	scenarios	the	company	came	up	with	immediate	action	plans	leaning	all	operations	by	reducing	costs	without	affecting	employees	and	customers	increasing	revenues	by	selling	to	add	new	channels	on	shopee	and	lazada	using	seo	tools
this	action	plan	has	even	increased	sales	over	the	previous	year	and	upgrading	the	after	sales	service	team
without	heavy	workloads	the	company	switched	their	work	to	focus	more	on	upgrading	the	erp	barcode	system	resulting	in	more	streamlined	work	system
the	company	focused	more	on	making	improvements	and	learning	how	to	earn	favor	from	customers	and	then	use	that	information	to	design	experiences	meeting	customer	needs
how	can	scb	support	smes
khun	pikun	srimahunt	scb	chief	sme	banking	officer	mentioned	the	bank	of	thailands	soft	loan	program	for	entrepreneurs	which	existing	scb	customers	can	apply	for	by	contacting	the	bank
current	sme	customers	with	credit	limits	not	exceeding	million	baht	are	eligible	for	soft	loan	limit	of	up	to	of	their	original	credit	line	and	with	installments	of	up	to	ten	years
new	customers	will	receive	maximum	credit	line	of	million	baht
the	key	for	doing	business	amid	this	crisis	is	to	adjust	upskill	and	transform
banks	can	provide	support	provide	credit	lines	extend	debts	and	provide	convenient	services	such	as	qr	payment	or	the	robinhood	food	delivery	platform	that	doesn	charge	gp	fees
for	retail	customers	khun	pimjai	tongmee	managing	director	scb	plus	said	that	during	the	covid	crisis	assistance	has	been	offered	by	many	involved	sectors	as	this	is	national	problem
banks	must	make	sure	that	their	customers	survive
the	most	important	thing	is	that	the	relationship	between	customers	and	the	bank	should	be	long	term	open	and	sincere
even	now	while	everyone	is	trying	to	help	some	customers	refuse	to	bring	their	problems	to	the	bank
to	be	able	to	help	customers	must	tell	us	the	problems	they	are	facing
the	bank	is	willing	to	support	them	all
payment	holidays	are	short	term	solution	while	covid	is	long	term	problem
banks	need	to	prolong	their	lifelines	for	customers	by	extending	loan	terms	such	as	implementing	step	payment	plans	which	means	paying	less	in	the	beginning	according	to	their	current	status
however	if	customers	stop	paying	it	will	affect	their	credit	score	if	they	want	new	loans	when	the	economy	rebounds
therefore	consistency	is	very	important
scb	is	keen	to	have	good	relationships	with	our	customers
in	normal	times	customers	seeking	new	payment	plans	may	be	considered	vulnerable
however	in	this	special	situation	we	consider	them	to	be	good	customers	because	all	parties	involved	must	be	willing	to	support	one	another	to	get	through	the	crisis	together
what	should	do	if	want	loan
khun	sakkawat	itthasawad	evp	of	scb	business	banking	relationships	management	division	touched	upon	the	pain	points	of	applying	for	sme	loans
he	said	that	common	problem	is	that	some	entrepreneurs	can	run	their	businesses	but	cannot	sell	their	stories
khun	sakkawat	said	that	getting	loan	can	be	likened	to	borrowing	money	from	friend
how	can	you	assure	your	friend	that	they	will	get	repaid
do	we	have	clear	business	plan
what	are	the	key	success	factors
you	need	to	provide	proof	of	how	your	business	is	doing	such	as	revenues	sales	costs	financial	performance	account	movements	and	payment	records	of	your	home	loan	or	credit	card	if	any
these	numbers	are	critical	for	credit	approval
bank	lending	is	approved	based	on	the	principle	comprising	capital	capacity	to	repay	collateral	and	conditions	referring	to	prevailing	business	conditions
entrepreneurs	must	prepare	the	latest	year	financial	statements	historical	bank	statements	related	tax	filing	forms	and	other	records	of	income	versus	expenses
the	problem	with	ssmes	is	that	their	business	is	carried	out	on	cash	basis	and	not	backed	by	bank	accounts
however	tools	such	as	mobile	banking	applications	which	are	are	very	common	nowadays	such	as	mae	manee	qr	payments	can	easily	capture	your	cash	transactions	to	reflect	cash	flow
such	information	will	be	useful	for	credit	approval
what	if	smes	are	unable	to	survive	despite	loan
sme	owners	are	advised	to	contact	the	bank	involved
however	they	should	make	efforts	to	adjust	their	business	process	by	learning	costs	or	adding	new	selling	channels	as	banks	will	consider	their	potential
business	plans	proving	revenue	sources	will	be	an	important	factor	in	ensuring	that	companies	can	generate	sales
if	profits	are	used	for	investing	in	assets	they	should	also	provide	evidence
what	many	people	misunderstand	is	that	customers	seeking	debt	restructuring	will	be	viewed	as	having	financial	problems	and	therefore	vulnerable
thus	they	suffer	from	installments	that	do	not	reflect	their	actual	situations
in	such	cases	revealing	your	problems	to	the	bank	to	adjust	your	installments	is	better	option
if	you	insist	on	continuing	to	suffer	while	your	business	is	not	viable	you	will	not	have	any	backup	funds	if	the	situation	gets	worse
we	would	recommend	customers	come	to	us	to	reduce	their	burdens	so	they	have	more	money	to	use	for	their	businesses
when	the	economy	recovers	it	can	pay	off	debt	according	to	loan	conditions
if	their	business	resumes	strongly	their	payment	plans	can	be	readjusted
paying	back	quickly	means	debts	will	be	reduced	rapidly
use	the	right	financial	products	to	reduce	financial	costs	khun	silinlak	also	shared	her	experience	about	using	the	right	products	to	help	reduce	financial	costs
for	example	she	previously	used	od	to	settle	all	types	of	payments
later	when	she	learned	about	tr	and	used	that	facility	for	foreign	transfers	she	saved	money	as	the	interest	rate	was	cheaper	by	half
entrepreneurs	should	talk	to	rms	about	using	the	right	financial	products	as	some	may	not	be	familiar	with	bank	products	such	as	fx	online	that	offer	better	exchange	rates	save	time	and	are	very	convenient
customers	can	also	buy	currency	options	to	close	their	currency	risk	exposure
talking	with	your	bank	is	very	important	because	it	lets	both	parties	realize	the	problems	they	are	facing
the	bank	is	ready	to	listen	to	the	problems	of	our	customers	as	friend
sincere	communication	will	allow	the	bank	to	support	them	in	the	long	term
can	retail	individuals	apply	for	business	loan
normally	banks	approve	loans	based	on	income	projection	and	see	if	you	have	other	loans	with	the	bank	such	as	auto	loans
then	banks	must	verify	your	income
banks	want	information	from	customers
the	important	factor	is	your	discipline	and	intention	to	pay
this	will	allow	customers	to	receive	more	loans
on	the	other	hand	if	contract	is	breached	once	or	twice	it	may	take	years	to	restore	your	credibility
in	other	words	your	financial	records	and	relationship	are	very	important	in	earning	trust
if	you	do	business	mainly	with	cash	you	should	put	some	money	into	the	bank	to	let	the	bank	know	how	much	you	earn
previously	you	may	not	have	had	time	to	go	to	the	bank
however	we	now	have	qr	payment	and	mobile	banking	for	more	convenience
bank	of	thailand	soft	loans	for	aiding	smes	have	total	credit	line	of	billion	baht	at	fixed	interest	rate	for	the	first	years	and	the	average	interest	rate	for	years	is	not	more	than
smes	can	request	loan	of	up	to	of	their	original	credit	line	as	of	december	or	february	whichever	amount	is	higher	less	the	soft	loan	limit	previously	received	according	to	the	financial	aid	ministerial	regulation	issued	in	however	the	maximum	limit	shall	not	exceed	million	baht	with	installments	of	up	to	years
credit	guarantees	can	be	provided	by	the	thai	credit	guarantee	corporation	tcg

the	change	of	economic	landscape	and	world	trade	power	have	driven	vietnam	to	be	one	of	the	eye	catching	markets	for	investors
jaspal	company	limited	the	leader	in	fashion	retailing	business	is	thai	company	that	has	expanded	its	business	in	vietnam
khun	chanida	saichua	jaspals	chief	finance	officer	shared	us	about	an	opening	of	jaspal	branch	and	affiliates	including	its	growth	potential	in	vietnam
the	beginning	of	business	expansion	vietnam	appealing	market	khun	chanida	talked	about	an	opening	of	lyn	the	fashion	and	clothing	store	in	ho	chi	minh	city	vietnam	under	the	jps	fashion	vietnam	company	in	it	was	started	when	jaspal	found	that	lyn	leather	bags	have	been	popular	among	vietnamese	customers
jaspal	then	decided	to	expand	its	business	by	launching	lyn	as	the	first	brand	in	vietnam	following	by	superdry	jelly	bunny	and	ccoo
all	those	brands	are	now	available	in	more	than	stand	alone	stores	located	on	high	streets	and	department	stores	in	ho	chi	minh	and	hanoi
sales	were	over	million	usd	in
vietnams	retail	market	has	high	potential	for	growth	with	some	interesting	factors	for	example	an	emerging	market	rising	star	of	clmv	countries	the	economic	is	booming	as	gdp	increases	continually	every	year	the	consumer	market	is	growing	due	to	the	rising	of	young	people	on	the	contrary	thailand	is	entering	an	aging	society
vietnamese	tend	to	earn	more	income	so	raising	the	number	of	the	middle	class
vietnam	is	manufacturing	based	country	in	southeast	asia	and	has	enticed	more	foreign	investors	so	it	has	tendency	to	grow	in	the	long	term
additional	to	vietnam	jaspal	invested	in	asian	countries	including	cambodia	where	there	are	stores	in	phnom	penh
lyn	is	strongly	successful	in	cambodia
the	country	is	close	to	thailand	and	is	able	to	access	thai	media	thats	why	cambodian	have	known	thai	brands	so	well	and	have	also	admired	our	quality	products
the	difference	between	vietnam	and	thailand	to	market	the	fashion	retailing	with	million	vietnamese	jaspal	needs	to	adjust	its	strategy	because	their	customer	behaviors	differ	from	thai	people
jaspal	still	keeps	brand	image	but	changes	marketing	campaign	like	day	promotion
jaspal	products	are	promoted	by	local	influencer	bloggers
vietnamese	are	familiar	with	lyn	and	the	challenge	is	another	brand	like	ccoo
the	marketing	team	needs	to	create	brand	awareness	by	studying	the	market	to	build	an	advertising	strategy	for	promoting	ccoo	products
as	the	brand	awareness	of	lyn	is	quite	good	so	local	celebrities	are	used	and	online	promotion	is	highly	focused	according	to	current	marketing	trend
for	customer	behavior	price	quite	matters	to	vietnamese	and	they	are	price	sensitive	comparing	with	thai	said	khun	chanida
apart	from	the	offline	channels	online	marketing	is	second	to	none
jaspal	just	introduced	an	online	product	ordering	and	has	used	social	media	as	communication	tool	with	customers
sales	have	to	be	more	approachable	for	customers	through	line	or	facebook
the	service	is	chat	shop	and	then	to	make	following	up	call	to	them
anyway	online	marketing	has	limitations	and	gains	well	response	in	some	product	groups	like	lyn	bags	and	shoes
bags	are	easily	sold	online	but	online	sales	of	clothing	are	not	good	enough	especially	fashionable	wear	in	which	the	size	of	each	collection	varies
thats	why	customers	dont	prefer	online	shopping
most	people	who	buy	clothes	online	tend	to	return	them	later
adapt	strategy	to	lessen	the	effects	of	covid	during	the	outbreak	of	covid	early	last	year	branch	stores	in	vietnam	temporarily	closed	regarding	lockdown	policy
the	bangkok	office	followed	up	the	situation	closely	and	reviewed	business	plan	to	reduce	all	product	manufacturing	plans	in	vietnam	including	products	in	the	thai	market	and	other	countries
our	immediate	adaptation	plan	eventually	helped	lessen	the	effects	of	the	covid	crisis
what	are	the	risks	of	running	business	in	vietnam
in	general	the	vietnam	market	looks	prosperous	undoubtedly	there	are	risks	in	the	business	world
khun	chanida	divided	risk	into	two	parts	comprising	market	risk	such	as	store	rent	cost	is	higher	than	thailand
for	retailing	the	rental	fee	in	vietnam	is	considered	expensive	comparing	with	an	opportunity	in	generating	sales
there	are	tons	of	competitors	so	the	competition	is	high	and	its	not	easy	to	make	profit	while	the	number	of	tourists	is	lower	comparing	with	thailand
another	part	is	regulatory	risk	which	includes	regulations	of	company	registration	national	bank	rules	and	tax	criteria	and	other	government	concerned	issues
all	those	practices	must	be	legally	conducted	to	protect	the	company	from	bad	reputation
in	summary	regulatory	risk	in	vietnam	is	extensive	as	vietnam	remains	socialism	country	so	there	are	plenty	of	documents	to	submit	and	the	process	is	quite	complex
however	commercial	bank	like	scb	is	located	in	ho	chi	minh	city	to	support	and	ensure	smooth	opening	of	new	market	khun	chanida	summarized	that	we	dont	only	need	financial	loan	for	investing	overseas	but	we	also	want	the	bank	to	provide	us	with	insightful	information	about	the	market	and	regulations
and	scb	in	vietnam	has	long	been	well	known	in	the	vietnam	market	which	we	consider	very	important
every	bank	offers	the	same	financial	service	but	we	select	the	bank	that	is	expertise	in	particular	market	because	its	value	added	service	given	to	us	customers	who	are	interested	in	running	business	in	clmv	or	great	mekong	subregion	gms	comprising	cambodia	laos	myanmar	and	vietnam	scb	is	pleased	to	serve	you	at	several	overseas	branches
so	that	your	overseas	business	is	not	interrupted
scb	overseas	branch	network	is	ready	to	support	and	provide	services
by	kathanyu	sawangsri	hi	lights	after	being	fired	my	mind	was	completely	depressed
because	besides	being	fired	was	chased	away	from	my	dream	job
life	after	that	was	both	depressed	and	felt	that	myself	worthless
ve	looked	at	myself	in	the	mirror	and	cursed	myself	that	youre	just	poor	guy	and	was	crying	there	completely	lost	self	respect
through	the	day	and	night	started	to	heal	myself
suddenly	got	the	idea	that	already	had	nothing	to	do	ordination	is	better	choice
never	thought	that	going	to	ordain	will	become	one	of	the	best	decisions	in	life
the	idea	that	changed	me	was	result	of	being	fired
this	event	brought	me	to	different	life	both	the	lifestyle	and	the	results	of	various	things	around	me	that	happens
before	reaching	the	results	would	like	to	tell	you	about	the	inner	conditions	that	have	changed
which	does	not	change	only	the	surface	of	the	idea	but	go	deeper	into	the	level	of	feelings	beliefs	and	faiths	that	are	in	life	stopped	sticking	to	the	way	of	life	created
this	matter	is	very	important	because	earlier	thought	that	my	life	had	only	one	way
the	most	valuable	meaning	must	be	like	this	and	ignoring	other	lifestyles
but	when	all	that	collapsed	it	made	me	think	about	other	values	of	life	that	are	not	attached	to	one	thing
found	new	values	in	life
the	ordination	made	me	discover	the	meaning	of	making	others	happy
still	remember	the	smile	and	happiness	in	every	morning	when	my	grandmother	offered	food	to	me	as	monk
can	do	any	work	that	can	give	an	income	and	be	able	to	take	care	of	the	people	around	me	to	be	happy
choose	to	value	yourself	in	way	that	may	be	more	accurate
in	terms	of	work	after	could	do	anything
it	made	me	discover	many	new	potentials
after	crossing	the	attachment	of	must	be	only	writer
stopped	cursing	myself	in	the	mirror	and	turned	myself	proudly
today	we	even	have	many	more	opportunities	equipment	that	is	ready	for	us	to	create	new	things
sometimes	we	may	not	have	to	rush	to	tell	ourselves	what	we	should	be	or	can	do	just	one	thing
of	course	believe	in	finding	myself
but	finding	self	today	is	more	complicated	than	before
in	simple	terms	in	the	past	day	we	may	find	ourselves	with	some	work	that	is	valuable	to	the	world
but	when	the	world	changed	the	format	of	the	work	is	different
many	professional	careers	disappear
new	career	arises	through	technology	that	changes	the	way	people	live	moving	fast	and	the	pace	of	change	is	getting	faster	every	day
therefore	having	someone	to	stop	his	meaning	with	one	profession	may	not	always	be	the	right	way	for	everyone
for	me	finding	myself	to	have	good	life	in	this	society	is	to	find	my	outstanding	skills	that	do	well
the	one	that	can	be	continuously	developed	endlessly
at	the	same	time	this	skill	must	give	us	happiness	to	act	and	benefit	others
in	short	think	finding	self	today	is	discovery	skills	that	give	happiness	to	yourself	and	others	many	times	we	may	continue	our	life	with	only	half	of	the	correct	skills
there	may	be	another	half	or	the	whole	new	skill	that	we	have	not	known	yet
finally	finding	yourself	may	never	end
the	world	and	we	are	constantly	changing
being	fired	from	dream	job	made	me	discover	that	do	not	have	to	be	writer	or	anything	that	only	hope	for
there	are	things	that	we	never	expected	hidden	under	the	potential	that	we	may	have	never	met
just	do	the	good	things	in	our	life	both	for	ourselves	and	the	loved	ones	around	you
life	will	lead	us	to	move	forward
the	value	of	life	is	diverse	and	the	meaning	of	life	is	not	just	one	format
all	learned	because	of	that	dismissal	and	always	appreciate	this	event
in	world	without	borders	the	startups	focus	on	the	business	scale	only	the	domestic	market
may	affect	growth	in	many	ways
when	expanding	to	other	countries	still	hesitant	not	sure	whether	the	results	will	be	worth	the	cost	or	not
khun	rangsan	promprasit	or	khun	jo	ceo	of	queq	thailand	co	ltd	who	changing	queues	for	restaurants	and	shops	which	is	very	waste	of	time	and	energy	to	reserve	the	queue	through	the	app	instead
create	better	experience	for	customers
came	to	share	the	story	of	stepping	into	the	international	market	of	the	hottest	thai	blood	start	ups	at	this	minute	why	thai	startups	need	to	go	international	in	khun	jo	perspective	expanding	into	the	international	market	is	very	important	for	successful	startup	to	the	unicorn	level
because	it	is	expanding	the	market	to	scale	the	business	to	be	attractive	enough	for	investors	who	are	large	corporations	corporate	venture
that	past	thai	startups	that	are	only	marketed	in	the	country	will	face	difficulty	in	raising	funds	from	foreign	investors
because	it	will	be	seen	that	the	small	scale	company	and	the	customer	market
as	result	thai	startups	are	overlooked	by	investors
compared	to	other	startups	doing	regional	marketing	the	idea	set	that	must	success	in	the	country	first	is	one	of	the	reasons	why	thai	startups	give	less	and	give	less	weight	to	go	international	compared	to	singapore	small	domestic	market
startup	singapore	therefore	aims	to	expand	overseas	markets	from	the	first	day	of	doing	business
this	global	mindset	in	singapore	has	been	made	since	the	generation	of	grandparents	to	young	people	today
his	start	up	is	therefore	having	source	of	knowledge	and	experience	of	previous	generations	to	help	expand	the	business	quickly	and	the	government	also	provides	full	support
however	khun	jo	gave	some	examples	thai	startups	that	have	expanded	into	international	markets	such	as	omise	acommerce	builk	eatigo	eko	nasket	deep	pocket	get	links	tellscore	bellugg	wisesight	eventpop	cookly
by	startups	that	dare	to	market	internationally	often	founder	co	founder	is	foreigner
and	although	thailand	is	interesting	in	terms	of	market	value	it	turns	out	that	the	most	popular	user	startup	is	the	startups	from	the	surrounding	countries
currently	many	countries	use	guidelines	to	encourage	startups	to	register	businesses	in	the	country	causing	fundraising	and	income	to	flow	to	those	countries
queq	and	go	international	with	accelerator	queq	business	model	is	to	reserve	restaurants	shops	services	queues
through	the	application	on	smartphone
therefore	in	addition	to	customer	behavior	the	queq	business	model	wants	to	adjust	the	store	operating	system	to	communicate	with	customers	through	the	queq	platform
the	domestic	market	is	divided	into	ways	using	salespeople	to	take	care	of	customers	restaurant	chains	and	organizing	seminar	to	educate	small	sme	restaurant	operators
when	it	comes	to	international	markets	the	method	is	naturally	different
singapore	is	queq	first	international	market
khun	jo	using	the	method	of	establishing	joint	venture	with	local	partner	the	queq	thai	team	takes	care	of	the	platform
the	partner	team	manages	the	operation
however	in	the	case	of	queq	the	payback	period	is	months	which	is	quite	long	time	causing	local	partner	company	that	already	has	business	to	make	money	not	supporting	queq	businesses	as	much	as	they	should
from	experience	in	singapore	causing	khun	jo	to	srtartup	the	queq	office	overseas	himself
malaysia	is	the	first	market	where	khun	jo	first	opens	queq	office
by	starting	with	the	magic	accelerator	project	startup	entrepreneur	project	sponsored	by	the	malaysian	government
to	learn	the	rules	regulations	business	laws	and	including	getting	to	know	the	other	operator	founder	startup	people
bringing	connection	and	knowledge	to	do	business	in	the	market	in	that	country
in	which	this	event	jo	met	mr	shang	leong	who	became	country	manager	of	queq	malaysia
khun	jo	said	that	finding	team	leader	in	an	office	abroad	is	like	finding	co	founder
because	he	must	do	everything	and	solve	every	problem	like	when	jo	started	queq	in	thailand	so	must	be	someone	who	has	passion	for	creating	queq	successfully
shang	leong	is	the	right	man
continuing	from	malaysia	khun	jo	also	focuses	on	the	taiwan	market
this	began	by	joining	the	accelerator	project	sponsored	by	the	taiwanese	government	like	taiwan	tech	arena	and	working	with	advantech	open	office	in	taiwan
launched	quepai	app	queq	taiwan	version
and	as	taiwanese	people	like	to	walk	to	various	exhibitions	booth	exhibition	at	the	exhibition	is	one	way	to	find	sme	customers
the	latest	country	that	queq	opens	in	is	japan
although	it	seems	that	queuing	is	culture	of	japanese	people	but	when	khun	jo	talked	with	the	staff	of	the	japan	external	trade	organization	jetro	he	understood	that	the	essence	of	japanese	culture	is	respect	for	the	rights	of	others
queuing	to	line	up	has	been	thing	for	long	time	if	there	is	new	way	to	preserve	the	essence	of	respect	for	other	rights	as	before	it	is	new	option	that	japanese	people	should	be	interested	in
khun	jo	then	opened	the	japanese	market	by	attending	the	accelerator	fukuoka	city	workshop	sponsored	by	the	japanese	government
by	looking	at	the	japanese	market	as	suitable	for	queq	business	model	because	in	the	narrow	storefront	in	japan	must	queue	up	multiple	times	in	order	to	prevent	blocking	other	shops
including	the	use	of	ticket	machine	that	the	queq	application	will	change	at	this	point	by	sending	orders	to	the	kitchen	not	just	reserving	the	queue
in	addition	to	the	three	top	countries	queq	is	expanding	into	laos
by	setting	up	joint	venture	company	including	cambodia	and	the	philippines	through	reseller	methods
why	it	must	be	government	supported	accelerator
khun	jo	said	about	joining	accelerator	to	enter	the	ecosystem	of	the	country	to	be	marketed
the	choice	of	participating	in	project	supported	by	the	government	will	help	with	legal	issues	and	regulations
that	may	be	difficult	without	government	assistance	and	helps	to	strengthen	the	network
as	well	as	creating	credibility	in	the	eyes	of	users	in	each	country	as	well
for	example	japanese	users	would	not	prefer	to	use	apps	for	foreign	startups	but	will	choose	to	use	the	japanese	startup	app	first
therefore	the	queq	app	has	joined	fukuoka	city	accelerator	to	create	credibility	and	relate	to	the	japanese	authorities	in	the	sense	of	the	user
therefore	the	queq	app	has	joined	fukuoka	city	accelerator	to	create	credibility	and	relate	to	the	japanese	authorities	in	the	sense	of	the	user
or	in	the	case	of	the	taiwan	market	company	registration	has	strict	rules
support	from	taiwan	agencies	is	important
all	documents	are	in	traditional	chinese	so	there	must	be	taiwanese	help
the	opening	of	bank	account	has	also	been	rigorously	checked	that	businesses	do	not	have	any	chinese	capital	involved
get	ready	before	going	internationally
about	preparing	to	expand	to	international	markets
khun	jo	said	interesting	issues	are	the	cost	and	the	operations	to	support	the	foreign	office
as	for	the	cost	of	queq	going	to	open	foreign	office	the	main	expense	is	matter	of	people
which	is	responsible	for	selling	the	product	to	customer	service
but	for	the	product	the	business	solution	platform	service	is	not	an	additional	cost	because	it	is	almost	all	reuse	of	the	same	item
there	is	taiwanese	version	in	the	chinese	version	of	the	app	called	qpai	from	paidui	which	means	queuing
the	other	part	is	the	reorganization	of	the	organization	structure	creating	dedicated	foreign	office	support	team
because	the	foreign	office	only	has	employees	as	needed
for	the	sales	product	customer	service	there	must	be	team	in	thailand	to	gradually	support	the	foreign	office
khun	jo	concluded	that	the	importance	of	expanding	overseas	markets	is	that	there	are	many	strategies	and	methods	depending	on	the	type	of	business	and	the	nature	of	the	target	country
with	the	expansion	into	foreign	countries	thai	startups	will	not	miss	significant	opportunity	to	raise	funds	from	investors	which	will	affect	long	term	success
in	starting	business	from	day	the	idea	of	do	it	in	the	country	first	may	need	to	be	re	reviewed	so	that	thai	startups	will	not	miss	the	opportunity	to	advance	to	the	unicorn	level	in	the	future
note	chinese	characters	are	divided	into	simplified	chinese	used	in	china	mainland	china	malaysia	and	singapore	and	traditional	chinese	used	in	taiwan	hong	kong	and	macau
for	sme

whatever	the	situation	is	entrepreneurs	still	need	to	retain	their	businesses	and	keep	walking
finding	new	market	especially	markets	that	can	overcome	the	covid	crisis	is	significant
not	only	the	thai	market	our	neighboring	country	like	cambodia	is	also	attractive	for	investment
cambodia	is	fast	growing	country	in	economics	trading	and	investment
even	though	most	trading	follows	traditional	pattern	but	online	marketing	is	amazingly	booming	due	to	the	government	backup	and	extensive	platforms	that	serve	online	product	marketing

wonder	whether	you	realize	that	thailand	is	the	most	popular	place	to	fly	to	among	the	digital	nomad	peoples	who	work	without	office	by	digital	facilities
surveys	conducted	among	several	nomad	groups	indicated	possibility	to	open	the	new	business	market	to	welcome	digital	nomad	customers	in	the	st	century
why	thailand	is	the	dream	destination	for	digital	nomad	the	new	trend	among	this	group	of	people	to	work	while	traveling	overseas	is	now	observed	as	new	working	pattern	that	might	replace	many	salaried	jobs
bangkok	chiang	mai	and	phuket	have	been	rated	as	the	most	popular	places	by	online	customers	of	the	nomad	list
the	first	factor	that	attracts	nomadic	peoples	to	pack	up	with	laptop	for	no	longer	being	highly	paid	salary	workers	is	the	friendly	cost	of	living	to	ensure	the	worthwhile	long	period	staying
this	of	course	includes	lower	costs	for	all	living	facilities	of	more	or	less	the	same	quality	comparing	to	that	in	europe
the	next	important	factor	is	internet	system	which	is	the	most	crucial	supporter	for	the	digital	working	system
thailand	has	enhanced	development	of	internet	system	with	wider	coverage	capacity	comparing	to	our	first	competitor	bali	which	is	of	lower	rating	than	us	in	this	sector
another	major	factors	are	entertainment	and	fun	so	that	they	can	relax	after	their	hard	working	hours
thailand	is	full	of	fun	in	all	communities	with	different	charms	and	characteristics	in	each	location
as	for	safety	which	is	of	the	lower	rating	compared	to	other	sectors	but	it	is	of	the	acceptable	criteria	for	the	digital	nomad
digital	nomad	the	new	business	market	accordingly	the	access	towards	this	group	will	provide	new	earning	opportunity	since	the	average	staying	period	is	double	of	the	general	tourism
in	certain	cases	it	may	last	for	years	without	uncertainty	and	flexibility	generally	caused	by	travelers
the	survey	conducted	in	the	united	states	indicated	that	of	working	people	are	willing	to	work	while	travelling	with	supports	by	their	companies
this	group	of	peoples	want	to	work	closely	with	the	community	for	being	inspired	to	create	their	work	whereas	it	is	also	required	to	enhance	communication
the	survey	by	harvard	university	disclosed	as	well	that	digital	nomad	peoples	will	choose	to	do	their	businesses	only	at	the	place	of	least	expenditure	where	they	can	travel	from	their	homes	in	us	and	europe	to	southeast	asia	as	it	is	their	second	homes
more	than	of	the	digital	nomad	are	the	owners	of	small	business	and	firstly	invested	in	their	own	countries	by	some	us	but	even	those	of	higher	income	would	as	well	choose	to	move	to	the	worthwhile	country	for	investment
the	largest	digital	nomad	group	comprises	of	of	thirty	years	old	people	who	mainly	left	their	boring	jobs	in	financial	business	and	consultants	to	seek	adventure	and	fulfill	their	lives	by	more	interesting	matters
if	you	are	resort	owner	and	want	to	access	this	market	remember	that	being	the	hit	destination	is	already	advantage	in	your	hand
what	you	need	to	add	is	the	high	speed	wifi	system	of	hrs
security	system	and	the	relaxing	atmosphere	of	personal	working	environment
but	they	should	not	be	discriminated	by	other	travelers	while	they	are	seriously	tuning	the	system	in	front	of	the	screen
nevertheless	the	single	room	should	be	available	as	an	alternative	to	allow	personalized	boarding
you	should	also	prepare	pricing	lists	for	both	weekly	or	monthly	staying
if	your	resort	is	among	coffee	shops	with	working	space	or	with	coworking	space	then	you	would	be	of	more	advantageous
be	friendly	with	them	and	ask	for	co	promotion	to	provide	the	package	facility
lastly	although	they	come	for	working	but	the	digital	nomad	also	need	friends	and	socialized	opportunity
community	touring	or	parties	at	appropriate	timing	would	be	welcomed	by	them
many	of	them	have	mentioned	added	good	points	that	parties	are	not	only	for	fun	but	also	chances	to	get	to	know	people	in	other	fields	for	setting	up	collaborated	networks	to	support	each	other
thailand	is	apparently	slow	to	accept	this	trend
therefore	the	opportunity	is	still	widely	available	whereas	in	the	west	there	is	already	the	roam	network	which	presents	itself	as	the	coliving	and	coworking	with	branches	in	london	and	tokyo
another	one	is	the	welive	with	member	facilities	in	new	york	and	washington	this	group	is	of	the	we	work	network	which	provides	large	co	working	spaces	in	major	cities	in	the	united	states	and	various	regions
moreover	the	clear	specific	target	groups	will	allow	for	appropriate	alternative	marketing	channels	for	instance	advertisement	or	public	relations	through	social	media	including	the	right	person	with	influenc	idea	among	the	digital	nomad

lean	is	concept	that	reduces	waste	in	the	production	process
suitable	for	factory	or	production	operators
by	turning	waste	into	value	this	makes	it	possible	to	manage	the	production	process	more	efficiently
it	also	helps	the	cost	of	production	very	well
dr	suriya	lean	experts	and	consultants	share	their	knowledge	with	participants	in	the	digital	smart	manufacturing	course	for	smes	in	the	manufacturing	industry	to	reduce	costs	increase	productivity	and	achieve	esg	sustainability	with	iot
know	kaizen	for	the	better	change	dr	suriya	said	that	if	lean	was	abbreviated	to	make	it	easier	to	see	there	will	be	only	about	value	and	waste
an	important	tool	in	doing	lean	is	value	steam	map
it	is	tool	to	help	clearly	see	the	flow	and	waste
focusing	on	visibility	and	eliminating	or	reducing	waste	without	waiting	for	perfection	is	to	do	it	gradually	like	japanese	management	strategy	called	kaizen
kaizen	principle	of	kaizen	delegate	responsibility	for	results	to	frontline	workers	empowerment	have	goals	for	qcdpis	quality	cost	delivery	yield	backlog	safety
the	assumption	is	that	if	the	work	meets	the	standard	standard	work	the	result	should	be	the	target
when	an	abnormality	occurs	employees	will	gather	to	analyze	the	cause	and	take	action	to	improve
employees	will	summarize	their	improvements	and	learnings	in	an	report
dr	suriya	gave	an	example	of	fast	cap	in	the	united	states	that	the	factory	manager	has	created	factory	culture	called	the	morning	walk
it	is	daily	walk	to	the	production	line	in	the	morning
to	greet	all	staff	and	asked	the	staff	what	would	you	like	to	improve	today
do	anything	better	to	save	seconds	plant	managers	doing	this	can	be	double	edged	sword
must	talk	and	understand	with	employees	that	it	is	not	mistake
but	to	create	corporate	culture	the	executives	must	be	consistent
must	be	seen	as	an	example	every	day	once	the	employees	have	adapted	they	will	stay	on	their	own
maintaining	the	standard	of	the	factory	is	something	that	cannot	be	neglected
leaders	make	these	cultures	possible
gemba	japanese	work	culture	dr	suriya	mentioned	gemba	as	part	of	the	lean	principle	as	well
the	word	gemba	in	japanese	means	real	place	consisting	of	genba	real	place	such	as	walking	out	to	explore	the	actual	site	genbutsu	real	things	such	as	going	to	see	holding	observing	the	real	product	genjitsu	real	situations	such	as	going	out	to	see	the	real	problem	situation	genri	the	theory	that	is	actually	relevant	such	as	looking	at	production	standards	and	gensoku	real	related	conditions	such	as	looking	at	clauses	limited	see	the	regulations	that	apply
the	principle	of	gemba	is	to	see	it	with	your	own	eyes
to	see	the	facts	don	think	for	yourself	walk	out	to	see	the	real	job	site
and	it	is	also	considered	to	respect	the	opinions	of	employees
the	boss	will	not	continue	to	say	but	if	you	want	to	improve	might	ask	for	opinions	to	help	brainstorm	and	try	to	see	if	what	will	the	new	method	be
to	improve	or	modify	and	then	wait	and	see	what	the	results	will	be	there	are	also	things	that	lead	to	waste	contributors	to	waste	consisting	of	muri	overburden	means	too	heavy	to	do
do	not	allow	employees	to	exceed	human	limits

non	utilized	talent	get	to	know	pdca	how	to	create	quality	management	cycle	dr	suriya	mentioned	that	pdca	is	creating	culture	of	thought	to	provide	feedback	and	to	always	check	the	creation	of	new	knowledge	consisting	of	steps	plan	plan	do	do	do	check	check	and	act	improve	is	process	used	to	improve	the	work	to	be	systematic
the	goal	is	to	solve	problems	and	develop	continuously
to	achieve	good	results	dr	suriya	said	that	leaders	must	lead	by	example
let	employees	see	and	understand	it	will	enable	pdca	to	be	successful
smed	streamlines	production	smed	stands	for	single	minute	exchange	die	or	reduction	of	installation	time	is	the	set	up	time	of	the	machine	as	quickly	as	possible

this	is	to	increase	the	flexibility	of	production

convert	internal	set	up	to	external	set	up	improving	operation	methods	improve	equipment	eliminate	set	up	before	parting	dr	suriya	said	that	if	sme	entrepreneurs	can	understand	the	principles	of	kaizen	gemba	pdca	and	smed	it	will	be	an	important	tool	for	doing	lean	within	the	organization	more	efficiently
and	most	importantly	making	lean	successful
relies	on	the	business	owner	as	an	initiator	and	acts	as	an	example
for	employees	to	recognize	and	understand	able	to	adapt	and	put	into	practice	until	the	organization	culture
this	causes	changes	and	will	lead	to	lean	within	the	organization	sustainably	source	dr	suriya	lean	expert	and	consultant	director	of	the	digital	smart	manufacturing	program	for	smes	in	the	manufacturing	industry	reducing	costs	increasing	productivity	for	esg	sustainability	with	iot	in	may	at	siam	commercial	bank	ratchayothin	headquarters
for	sme
during	pandemic	covid	consumers	behavior	and	products	demand	has	changed	rapidly
smes	entrepreneurs	or	online	trading	should	know	which	products	are	selling	fast	and	which	are	not	and	if	the	situation	has	not	returned	as	before	how	would	they	adjust
those	who	can	give	the	best	answer	are	those	that	have	been	working	with	product	stocks	because	they	have	seen	changes	in	the	numbers	of	what	selling	fast	and	what	still	remain	in	the	stock

top	most	selling	product	mr	nithi	has	told	us	that	during	pandemic	the	number	of	orders	increase	from	transactions	to	transactions	per	day
on	some	day	it	can	get	up	to	transactions
when	sales	are	going	up	it	means	that	people	want	to	buy	more	online
then	what	is	the	best	selling
no	electronics	microphone	headphone	mouse	keyboard	stylus	wireless	router	to	use	for	working
no	bedding	microphone	headphone	mouse	keyboard	stylus	wireless	router	to	use	for	working
no	food	supplement	multi	vitamins	nourish	the	bodys	different	systems	and	those	who	work	at	home	have	to	be	in	front	of	computer	longer	than	before	so	they	want	to	take	care	of	their	eyes	and	brain	with	good	supplements
vitamin	helps	increase	the	immune	system
this	is	why	food	supplement	category	sales	increase	times	than	before
no	cosmetics	although	people	are	working	at	home	with	an	online	meeting	they	still	need	to	look	good	so	the	facial	foundation	is	very	important
during	these	times	we	are	wearing	mask	all	the	time	so	eyeliner	can	make	your	eye	looks	pretty
also	there	are	lot	of	promotions	so	sales	are	skyrocketed
no	cleaning	tools	dishes	clothes	washing	detergent	napkins	have	sales	transactions	of	over	within	minutes	especially	when	they	are	sold	in	pairs

soap	toothpaste	toothbrush	etc
no	kids	product	diapers	toys	and	feeding	nipples	are	all	necessary	for	kids
no	cooking	tools	normally	people	like	to	go	out	for	dinner	but	since	the	pandemic	they	tend	to	order	in	more
to	order	in	every	meal	will	be	very	expensive	compare	to	home	cook	meal	which	is	what	people	these	days	are	trending	for
they	can	make	sure	that	the	food	is	clean	and	healthy
no	covid	protective	equipment	thermometers	rubber	gloves	masks	and	alcohol	have	sales	increase	up	to	because	these	are	consumable	products	and	people	do	buy	more	than	one	piece
especially	at	the	beginning	of	the	pandemic	there	are	never	enough	supplies

as	an	energetic	and	freshly	graduated	young	man	you	would	expect	him	to	enjoy	bright	career	future
if	not	for	the	covid	he	would	have	been	flying	airplanes
with	the	pandemic	lives	have	turned	into	mishaps
however	athitaphon	note	chanthanakul	did	not	give	up
he	decided	to	look	for	job	that	would	keep	him	going	until	the	pandemic	is	over
note	switched	to	riding	bike	and	began	career	that	had	never	entered	his	mind	before
crisis	creates	opportunities	note	earned	bachelor	degree	in	airline	business	management	from	stamford	international	university	in	bangkok	in	many	careers	have	been	put	on	hold	as	result	of	the	pandemic
note	recent	graduate	is	no	exception
an	outgoing	individual	by	nature	during	his	studies	he	worked	as	teaching	assistant
after	graduation	his	professor	asked	him	to	teach	aviation	courses	at	the	phitsanulok	airport
but	due	to	the	pandemic	travel	bans	were	imposed	all	over	the	world	and	note	was	forced	to	seek	alternative	employment
despite	having	his	parents	financial	support	he	chose	to	be	independent	and	try	something	new
being	rider	is	not	dream	job
but	with	many	careers	have	slowed	down	being	rider	is	job	that	interested	him	because	he	could	be	independent	without	having	to	strictly	follow	nine	to	five	office	routine
it	would	also	allow	him	to	generate	good	income	during	the	pandemic
having	just	bought	new	motorcycle	he	saw	it	as	perfect	time	to	see	if	he	liked	being	delivery	rider	so	he	decided	to	use	his	new	bike	to	become	full	time	delivery	rider	from	am	to	pm
he	did	not	work	with	any	particular	company	or	do	only	delivery	jobs	but	also	accepted	messenger	jobs	delivering	documents	and	parcels
discover	meaning	in	your	work	after	running	jobs	with	his	new	motorcycle	for	several	months	note	heard	about	robinhood	third	rider	recruitment
he	didn	hesitate	to	apply
being	robinhood	rider	he	had	to	undergo	face	to	face	training	in	order	to	absorb	and	understand	robinhood	principles	of	work	etiquette	problem	solving	and	dos	and	donts	to	ensure	that	the	food	reaching	customers	was	in	perfect	condition
after	training	with	robinhood	better	understood	the	essence	of	this	profession
being	rider	is	more	than	just	riding	motorcycle	to	deliver	food	it	is	also	service	that	can	deliver	happiness	to	others
if	you	pay	enough	attention	you	will	get	that	happiness	in	return	said	note
at	some	shops	that	he	is	familiar	with	he	will	help	with	packing	or	help	out	in	their	kitchens
if	shop	has	long	queue	he	will	call	to	let	customers	know
when	delivering	cake	he	drives	slowly	and	pays	extra	attention
and	if	the	delivery	route	is	bumpy	and	the	cake	isnt	perfect	despite	his	efforts	he	will	call	customers	to	let	them	know
from	his	experience	the	most	difficult	critical	part	of	the	process	is	the	packaging
if	not	packed	properly	food	may	look	unappetizing	when	it	reaches	customers	and	they	may	not	be	impressed
some	meals	may	have	several	side	dishes	and	be	heavy	so	note	will	ask	the	shop	to	be	sure	to	pack	it	properly
note	even	prepares	extra	bags	just	in	case
he	once	even	pretended	to	be	customers	friend	to	spring	surprise	birthday	on	the	customers	mother	who	lived	in	another	house
these	are	few	of	the	things	he	can	do	to	impress	his	customers	and	bring	them	happiness
being	robinhood	rider	not	only	makes	note	feel	good	about	his	job	it	is	also	more	convenient	for	him	as	he	doesnt	need	to	advance	money	to	pay	for	food	or	handle	cash
he	can	accept	orders	with	more	peace	of	mind	and	doesnt	have	to	compete	with	anyone	but	himself
he	can	send	money	to	his	account	every	day
because	of	these	conveniences	note	mainly	delivers	for	robinhood
design	my	own	working	hours
can	do	it	whenever	want
thats	freedom	note	said
put	yourself	in	someone	elses	shoes	when	asked	about	the	difficulty	of	working	as	rider	note	said	that	customer	service	is	the	most	difficult	because	it	requires	understanding	and	care
also	use	restaurant	services
being	customer	from	time	to	time	know	their	expectations	and	demands
they	want	their	food	to	be	delivered	quickly	while	shop	owners	also	want	to	get	things	done	quickly	and	nicely
riders	are	intermediaries
if	you	understand	the	process	you	can	work	happily	without	pressure	said	note
being	rider	has	taught	note	to	be	more	patient	when	waiting	for	food	or	to	tolerate	emotional	restaurant	staff	and	customers
they	dont	know	which	restaurants	have	long	queues
if	they	have	to	wait	for	long	time	riders	might	be	blamed
note	therefore	calls	customers	to	let	them	know	if	there	will	be	long	wait
if	the	customer	understands	there	is	usually	no	problem
sometimes	customers	are	not	aware	that	riders	have	rules	forbidding	them	from	delivering	food	in	building
the	note	has	learned	to	be	more	flexible	to	assist	some	customers	if	necessary
being	rider	problems	can	occur	at	any	time
whether	im	at	fault	or	not	im	always	polite	and	explain	things
when	customers	see	that	we	truly	care	they	are	ready	to	listen	and	end	disagreements	nicely	note	shared	with	us	that	he	learned	good	service	manners	from	his	family	teachers	and	robinhood
it	helps	him	calm	down	and	readies	him	to	deal	with	every	situation	whether	it	about	work	or	people
another	thing	note	wants	to	share	is	when	you	meet	hot	tempered	people	you	need	to	calm	down	first	listen	and	solve	their	problems
you	should	try	to	understand	them
when	the	problem	is	settled	nobody	will	be	angry	anymore	beautiful	aspect	of	an	unexpected	career	the	note	is	member	of	the	new	generation	self	confident	hardworking	and	eager	to	bond	with	those	around	him
he	once	got	into	conversation	with	fellow	rider	who	was	waiting	for	food	at	an	adjacent	restaurant
during	the	conversation	he	learned	that	both	of	them	had	received	orders	from	the	same	customer
so	he	made	new	friend	riding	to	deliver	food	together
some	restaurants	that	see	note	waiting	for	orders	have	called	him	in	to	help	in	the	evening	and	provide	him	with	food
there	is	also	nice	aspect	about	customers
some	of	them	order	food	for	riders	and	some	have	become	friends	because	they	see	one	another	often	and	are	ready	to	support	each	other	when	needed
these	are	impressions	that	note	has	received	from	career	that	he	had	never	dreamed	of	before
even	now	that	the	government	has	reopened	the	country	and	note	can	return	to	his	teaching	career	at	the	phitsanulok	airport	he	continues	to	come	back	to	delivery	service	because	it	makes	him	happy
think	doing	the	right	thing	being	rider	because	gain	lot	of	experience	and	get	to	know	new	routes	restaurants	and	people
this	career	lets	me	meet	good	friends	new	communities	and	choose	my	own	working	hours
from	the	children	of	the	villagers	who	have	only	completed	secondary	school	education	with	only	the	mother	being	the	pillar	of	the	family
but	able	to	push	himself	so	far	that	it	becomes	the	owner	of	company	and	bread	and	bakery	factory	that	has	millions	of	sales	per	month
including	being	able	to	expand	to	new	factory	that	meets	modern	standards	and	has	high	production	capacity
how	did	he	get	to	this	point
learn	the	ways	of	thinking	about	work	and	how	to	overcome	the	crisis	from	mr	pairoj	chudsawang	managing	director	of	siam	go	interfood	co	ltd	bread	and	bakery	manufacturer	for	over	years	under	the	brand	pang	hot	which	is	sold	nationwide
as	well	as	contracting	the	production	of	oem	bread	for	many	famous	brands	that	are	sold	in	modern	trade	and	aiming	to	continuously	expand	the	business
from	merchants	selling	bread	at	the	market	to	owners	of	wholesale	bread	brands	nationwide	khun	pairoj	told	that	he	is	person	who	likes	to	sell	things	and	likes	to	save	from	he	was	child
with	the	loss	of	his	father	at	an	early	age	leaving	only	the	mother	who	is	the	pillar
mother	made	bunch	of	coconut	boiled	rice	with	banana	for	sale	and	him	being	the	person	who	walked	to	sell
on	the	weekends	and	holidays	also	work	because	he	likes	to	sell	things	and	likes	to	save
and	that	is	the	foundation	for	his	success	today
began	years	ago	by	ordering	other	people	bread	for	sale	at	the	market
but	with	small	investment	so	most	of	the	money	is	spent	on	buy	products
even	though	it	was	selling	well	the	margin	was	low
then	came	up	with	the	idea	of	making	his	own	bread	for	sale	by	studying	from	books	and	try	to	do
in	the	beginning	it	didn	work
he	had	to	throw	it	hundred	times	because	he	didn	have	experience
but	tried	to	do	every	day	until	it	got	better	because	wanting	the	best	dessert	to	come	out
from	indomitable	until	finally	the	first	bread	filling	is	custard	filling	is	successful	and	followed	by	taro	filling
therefore	be	sold	together	with	approximately	types	of	the	original	items
the	customers	were	fascinated	with	the	taste	until	the	customers	came	to	ask	why	the	custard	and	taro	filling	are	more	delicious	than	other	fillings
after	he	made	enough	on	his	own	then	stopped	ordering	from	others	and	selling	only	his	products	and	got	very	good	response
the	first	brand	was	named	hongte	and	sold	in	provinces
made	it	himself	sell	by	himself	at	the	flea	market	and	drive	the	saleng	car	to	sell
selling	at	the	market	just	put	in	the	bag	for	customers	they	could	not	do	in	time
therefore	trying	to	find	ideas	to	reduce	the	steps	to	make	it	faster
by	had	the	clamps	for	customers	to	choose	as	they	like
making	products	sell	better
at	that	time	the	sales	were	able	to	be	at	certain	level	but	he	thought	he	like	to	grow	more
by	expanding	the	market	from	market	per	day	increased	to	markets	per	day	by	hiring	employees	to	sell
but	there	is	problem	with	the	control	and	sales	management	is	not	up	to	standard
the	employees	do	not	intend	to	sell	as	if	by	himself
causing	lot	of	products	left
turned	out	to	be	like	loss
therefore	searching	for	new	channel	by	selling	at	small	shop	which	at	the	beginning	was	selling	very	well	many	times	better	than	selling	at	the	flea	markets
starting	from	car	to	cars	because	of	wanting	to	sell	more	but	also	encountering	the	same	staff	issues	because	of	lack	of	experience	in	managing	subordinates
selling	was	not	good	because	there	was	no	good	management
next	cancel	the	hongte	brand	and	change	to	pang	hot	brand	that	focuses	on	wholesale	nationwide	instead
pang	hot	has	about	fillings	receiving	good	responses	from	customers	because	of	selecting	good	raw	materials
produce	quality	bread	to	meet	the	needs	of	customers
from	the	basement	factory	to	modern	factory	that	can	produce	hundred	thousand	pieces	per	day	the	old	factory	first	started	as	small	house
under	the	house	and	garage	then	expanded	to	factory	in	front	of	the	house	over	square	meters
later	the	business	grew	steadily
the	old	factory	looks	cramped
therefore	aiming	to	have	large	modern	factory	standardized	and	able	to	compete	with	competitors
can	enter	modern	trade	as	oem	for	production	for	large	brands
as	result	of	the	habit	since	child	who	likes	to	save	made	him	have	funds	to	build	new	factory
khun	pairoj	said	that	some	money	was	saved	for	investment
another	part	for	use
being	less	educated	person	so	he	looks	at	the	example	of	successful	people	plus	reading	books	there	have	been	many	crises	and	has	survived	because	of	savings	and	have	new	factory	like	today	because	of	savings	as	well
and	plans	to	make	additional	products	under	the	pang	hot	brand
pang	hot	is	brand	that	grows	quickly	because	it	responds	well	to	customers
can	be	sold	throughout	the	country	by	focusing	on	wholesale	allowing	customers	to	make	more	profits	not	having	lot	of	costs	causing	customers	to	grow	together	and	most	importantly	being	rich	together
customers	grow	the	plant	also	grows
the	factory	does	not	leave	customers	walking	together	side	by	side	khun	pairoj	said
doing	business	must	have	bigger	goal	the	main	idea	of	khun	pairoj	is	wanting	to	sell	more	and	more	items
if	selling	single	place	get	single	shop
as	well	as	placing	fishing	rod	if	one	rod	is	placed	one	fish	can	be	obtained
but	if	you	can	place	fishing	hooks	more	than	fish
doing	business	also	there	will	be	set	target	and	the	target	must	keep	growing
we	do	business
we	have	goals
in	the	past	the	goal	has	been	successful	many	times
once	the	goal	is	reached	the	next	goal	is	to	move	forward
the	goal	does	not	stay	still	khun	pairoj	shares	the	thinking	methods	and	strategies	for	growing	business
which	the	target	will	be	set	from	sales
for	example	today	set	goal	of	million	baht	per	day
the	next	two	years	maybe	million	baht	per	day
if	the	target	is	in	the	millions	have	to	move	into	tens	millions	hundreds	millions	billions
which	may	find	additional	distribution	channels	and	have	more	products
starting	from	himself	did	it	alone	use	kg	of	flour	per	day
until	today	using	about	more	than	ton	of	flour	per	day
how	to	grow	up	today	from	people	who	have	just	secondary	school	graduated	because	he	has	goal
always	active	and	most	importantly	learn	all	the	time
the	word	learn	is	not	the	end
we	must	keep	learning
stepped	up	in	order	to	keep	growing
khun
pairoj	emphasized	the	importance	of	learning	and	goal	setting
the	long	term	goal	is	to	make	the	brand	in	the	minds	of	the	thai	people
sales	are	steadily	increasing
want	to	do	franchise	and	want	to	export	and	is	brand	that	can	be	sold	in	many	countries
would	like	to	make	unique	items	by	using	ingredients	that	can	be	found	in	samut	songkhram	province
make	it	souvenir	that	people	know	to	be	famous
thinking	of	using	products	that	were	in	samut	songkhram	to	be	processed	into	bread
which	has	never	been	done	before	make	new	products	came	up	to	meet	the	customers	needs	to	be	the	famous	souvenirs	of	the	province	how	did	covid	affect	business
when	covid	crisis	came	in	tried	to	do	all	kinds	of	things
since	selling	online	wholesale	increasing	more	distribution	channels
which	has	been	increased	from	the	covid	period
which	in	general	does	not	affect	much	everything	works	in	the	normal	factory	and	employees	do	not	take	time	off
but	sales	fell	by	about
the	reason	for	the	fall	was	the	modern	trade	department	stores	closed
oems	also	stopped	production	because	department	stores	were	unable	to	sell	products
but	pang	hot	can	still	sell	even	though	the	peak	is	slightly	falling
when	the	market	closed	the	impact	was	not	much
because	always	trying	to	stay	alert	and	do	what	is	enough	to	make	money	to	make	employees	have	income	and	save	cost
for	example	if	some	market	makes	small	profit	then	stop	and	reduce	all	unnecessary	things
employees	still	work	normally	every	day
as	well	as	planning	to	sell	the	products	to	the	front	of	the	house	and	other	compatible	products	such	as	fresh	coffee	for	sale	in	the	office	and	at	home
ammunition	cash	flow	in	doing	business	businesses	need	revolving	funds
getting	soft	loans	from	scb	and	the	bank	of	thailand	gives	him	peace	of	mind	when	doing	business	that	he	won	lack	liquidity
because	in	doing	business	everything	must	be	ready	if	we	lack	something	it	may	lead	to	discontinuity
but	if	the	business	has	working	capital	ready	with	bank	support	it	can	grow
the	soft	loans	acquired	through	scb	are	made	quickly
in	which	rm	came	to	contact	that	the	company	is	qualified	operator	and	has	been	good	customer	all	the	time
rm	of	scb	came	in	to	handle	it	in	days
soft	loan	is	the	first	month	interest	free	loan	after	interest	for	two	years	with	loan	of	of	the	outstanding	balance	on	december	this	allows	entrepreneurs	to	use	this	money	to	make	the	most	of	it	because	there	are	no	borrowing	costs
finding	funding	sources	like	this	is	very	rare	because	most	have	costs
all	the	soft	loan	processing	help	smes	save	more	reduce	the	cost	of	doing	lot	of	business	said	khun	pairoj
doing	business	is	like	war
having	liquidity	like	bullet	because	we	are	comfortable	that	we	have	ammunition	in	battle	doing	business	with	finance	makes	us	dare	to	walk	bravely	because	we	have	back	up
with	ammunition	in	it
khun	pairoj	compared	and	thanking	scb	and	the	bank	of	thailand	for	providing	soft	loans	to	enable	smes	to	overcome	this	crisis
must	fight	with	problems	until	win	have	problem	must	fight	with	it	until	win
doing	business	if	it	too	dark	then	we	must	find	solution
as	well	as	having	enthusiasm	for	himself	setting	life	goals
positive	thinking	will	make	us	move	forward
obstacles	are	normal
whatever	you	do	there	must	be	obstacles
must	be	ready	to	step	up	and	be	confident	that	you	can	do	it
anything	that	is	not	good	we	think	it	good	because	the	problem	has	both	sides	both	positive	and	negative	but	if	we	look	at	it	positively	then	we	can	grow	up
when	the	crisis	is	over	it	must	be	clear	sky	after	the	rain
khun	pairoj	concluded	to	give	encouragement	and	give	advice	to	entrepreneurs
positive	thinking	having	clear	business	goals	will	give	us	encouragement	and	patience	to	fight	problems	or	crises	that	can	occur	at	any	time
every	problem	has	solution
especially	financial	problems	or	lack	of	liquidity	there	are	financial	institutions	that	are	ready	to	help	to	replenish	your	business	through	the	crisis
scb	sme	is	ready	to	support	thai	businesses	to	grow	and	overcome	the	crisis
because	we	believe	in	the	potential	of	thai	smes
smes	interested	in	applying	for	soft	loan	can	contact	your	relationship	manager	or	call	the	call	center	at	for	sme	new	digital	banking	platform	for	enhancing	the	good	financial	experience	for	business	customers
as	we	are	general	salaryman	with	many	payment	loads	including	paying	for	condominium	and	taking	care	of	the	family
do	not	talk	about	saving	money	only	monthly	payment	is	hardly	enough	paid
due	to	our	cost	of	living	is	getting	higher	every	day	and	increasing	loan	interest	rate	annually	but	we	still	receive	the	same	salary
so	we	think	that	we	need	to	find	an	additional	job	to	earn	more	money	to	be	balanced	with	our	debt
however	our	full	time	job	consumes	our	time	almost	all	day	then	looked	around	and	found	post	office	next	to	the	office	and	thought	that	online	selling	might	be	good	idea
packing	products	according	to	customer	order	takes	less	time	compared	to	other	part	time	job	but	have	to	remind	myself	that	must	keep	only	small	stock	not	large	one	to	protect	myself	first
starting	from	selling	what	we	are	interested	in	and	use	is	safer	so	started	with	health	and	skincare	products
firstly	introduced	them	to	people	around	me	and	sell	small	amount	with	small	profit	which	was	not	significant
so	started	selling	via	instagram	and	it	was	only	few	customers	within	days
sometimes	there	was	no	order	for	week
was	tired	but	kept	posting	the	product	to	get	more	customers
months	passed	then	year	from	receiving	just	few	orders	week	to	everyday	order	which	changed	my	every	lunch	break	activity	to	be	walking	to	the	post	office	and	sent	parcels	to	customers
the	profit	has	increased	from	just	hundreds	turn	into	thousands	and	ten	thousand
have	earned	customer	trust	and	loyalty
they	continue	ordering	and	were	smiling	with	the	joy	of	the	profit	but	worried	about	shortage	stock	to	satisfy	customers	need
all	online	sellers	know	that	if	you	let	your	customers	wait	too	long	they	will	change	their	mind	and	find	other	shops
so	was	thinking	that	should	open	shop	to	store	larger	stock	and	let	someone	at	home	taking	care	of	it	while	pack	and	ship	for	daily	online	orders

khun	suteeraphan	sakarawat	assistant	general	manager	marketing	scb	shares	an	exclusive	marketing	strategy	especially	to	smes	in	an	online	training	course	called	the	dots	digital	commerce	reveal	marketing	budget	in	year	of	uncertainty	over	the	period	of	was	the	year	that	worldwide	business	faced	pandemic	covid	crisis	and	technology	challenges
lets	see	how	the	marketing	budget	in	those	years	was	set	for	each	industry
khun	suteeraphan	discloses	the	cmo	survey	from	sample	of	people
referring	to	gartner	research	when	comparing	and	the	marketing	budget	of	business	sectors	in	general	drops	drastically	from	in	to	in	when	viewed	as	the	business	segment	the	findings	are	travel	and	hospitality	declines	from	to	tech	product	from	to	media	from	to	and	manufacturing	from	to
media	penetration	in	the	era	of	uncertainty	when	considering	the	marketing	budget	distribution	in	marketing	channels	and	tools	the	gartner	survey	in	finds	that	communicate	with	every	customer	stage	by	race	model	what	is	race	model
khun	suteeraphan	adds	that	in	the	past	marketers	only	considered	reach	or	building	awareness
however	marketing	now	matters	more	than	that
marketing	has	to	reach	act	stage	to	drive	for	something	but	that	is	not	the	end
we	need	to	turn	to	convert	to	become	customers	and	elevate	them	to	engagement	stage
and	when	customers	have	brand	royalty	theyll	re	purchase	our	products
therefore	when	implementing	digital	marketing	dont	just	look	at	reach
we	must	look	through	whether	we	can	build	first	time	buyers	build	their	re	purchasing	convert	customers	to	have	royalty	and	create	their	stickiness
hype	cycle	for	digital	marketing	khun	suteeraphan	shares	his	view	on	digital	marketing	over	the	past	years	nothing	comes	and	nothing	goes
in	fact	things	have	increased	more	and	more	so	we	cant	stop	learning
when	talking	right	now	about	digital	marketing	its	no	longer	buying	facebook	ads	or	doing	seo
as	marketing	is	not	to	buy	ads	in	social	media	or	to	implement	search	engines	then	what	should	smes	in	this	era	study
khun	suteeraphan	recommends	that	we	should	find	some	helpers	to	create	digital	marketing	in	the	age	that	the	future	is	unpredictable	as	follows
master	keys	from	recommendations	recommendations	for	smes	to	do	digital	marketing	ads	optimization	develop	online	ads	efficiently	in	target	audience	budget	and	performance	in	order	to	find	the	perfect	mix	to	produce	suitable	ads	for	customer	groups
smes	should	look	for	helpers	to	understand	customer	context	and	see	the	clear	picture	of	which	channel	that	customers	know	our	brand	where	they	find	us	why	they	buy	and	why	they	re	purchase
its	also	recommended	to	create	brand	royalty	to	understand	and	know	customers	better	through	the	following	tools	for	developing	customer	journey	more	effectively
ab	testing	to	create	types	of	ads	and	over	and	consider	which	type	customers	like	best
those	ads	will	be	presented	to	customers	who	have	similar	characteristics	and	the	test	will	be	given	to	them	at	the	same	time
customer	personas	to	analyze	and	explain	customer	characteristics	in	different	dimensions	by	qualitative	data	to	know	lifestyle	decision	making	and	customer	behavior	in	depth
customer	journey	and	content	mapping	to	catch	up	on	customer	behavior	and	study	each	customer	journey	starting	from	knowing	products	to	buying	them	and	knowing	what	type	of	content	should	be	created	for	each	journey
vdo	content	create	video	content	for	social	media	such	as	tiktok	and	reels	as	they	still	gain	high	popularity	and	connect	to	new	generation
its	shown	that	of	gen	follow	influencers	from	social	media
big	data	ai	analyze	big	data	for	business	marketing	such	as	customer	engaging	time	timing	to	recontact	old	customers	upsell	or	re	purchasing	etc
digital	marketing	transformation	adjust	and	develop	technology	for	marketing	in	proper	ways
smes	should	clearly	study	their	own	businesses	and	realize	what	content	they	should	target	because	therere	abundant	dimensions	of	marketing	technology
pdpa	when	the	personal	data	protection	act	pdpa	is	set	out	smes	must	study	and	understand	the	essence	of	that	law	and	request	approval	from	customers
smes	will	be	charged	under	legal	punishment	if	they	breach	the	act
the	matters	that	customers	can	be	asked	to	provide	personal	data	are	get	discount	help	solve	problems	in	timely	manner	be	the	first	to	get	wanted	product	introduce	product	that	meets	their	interest	etc
finally	khun	suteeraphan	advises	smes	about	the	key	of	technology	adaptation	to	be	used	in	marketing	that	smes	dont	need	to	invest	everything	but	be	specific	insignificant	parts	that	generate	value	and	benefits	to	both	customers	and	the	business
its	not	to	sacrifice	for	investing	and	buying	everything	to	own	technologies	for	your	business

the	key	to	the	economy	is	production
which	one	important	production	factor	is	capital	and	in	undertaking	economic	activities	we	must	refer	to	or	consider	the	credit	system
therefore	bankruptcy	and	business	reorganization	laws	are	important	in	creating	investor	confidence
for	example	debtors	with	financial	problems	can	continue	to	operate	while	debtors	are	restructured	so	that	they	return	to	be	business	unit	in	the	economic	system	that	is	able	to	produce	and	compete
with	bankruptcy	and	business	rehabilitation	laws	helping	to	preserve	the	value	of	the	debtor	business	with	measures	called	conditions	of	the	automatic	stay
not	only	will	it	benefit	the	debtors	and	creditors	only	but	also	benefit	the	non	creditor	as	the	employee	of	the	debtor	trade	receivables
for	this	reason	it	can	be	said	that	the	said	law	can	promote	and	support	people	interested	in	doing	business
and	is	an	important	factor
foreign	investors	have	confidence	in	investing
or	choose	to	do	business	in	thailand
as	noted	by	the	united	nations	commission	on	international	trade	law	uncitral	that	if	any	bankruptcy	proceedings	lack	good	coordination	between	the	court	and	the	executing	officer	assets	that	will	be	brought	into	force	of	the	case	would	be	lost	fraudulent	or	concealed
this	not	only	affects	the	repayment	of	creditors	only	but	still	affecting	the	financial	status	of	bankrupt	companies	as	well	as	the	ability	to	conduct	business	in	the	future
because	such	laws	can	maintain	social	order	and	economic	stability
among	the	major	commercial	activities	of	thailand	is	one	type	small	and	medium	enterprises	also	known	as	smes	the	data	from	the	office	of	small	and	medium	enterprises	promotion	osmep	shows	that	in	gross	domestic	product	gdp	from	smes	was	worth	million	baht	accounting	for	percent	of	the	country	total	gdp
an	increase	of	percent	from	the	previous	year	with	growth	rate	of	percent	accelerating	from	an	expansion	of	percent	last	year
when	considering	the	value	of	gdp	according	to	the	size	of	the	enterprise	it	is	found	that	the	small	enterprise	se	has	the	value	of	gdp	equal	to	million	baht	representing	percent	and	the	medium	sized	enterprise	me	has	the	value	of	gdp	equal	to	million	baht	representing	percent
with	the	growth	rate	from	the	previous	year	equal	to	and	percent	respectively
smes	play	an	important	role	in	driving	the	economy	of	thailand
if	smes	encounter	financial	problems	with	more	debt	than	assets	or	the	debtor	is	unable	to	pay	the	debt
for	example	debtors	do	not	have	enough	assets	to	liabilities
or	the	debtor	has	the	insufficient	cash	flow	to	pay	the	debt	an	effective	bankruptcy	law	system	requires	business	rehabilitation	law	for	smes	to	provide	an	alternative	for	smes	to	increase	their	ability	and	strength	in	trade	competition	for	smes
however	smes	tend	to	have	different	characteristics
in	carrying	out	commercial	business	inevitably	has	financial	problems	or	experiencing	problems	in	trade	and	investment
such	as	lack	of	funding	sources	the	competitive	potential	is	small
until	the	losses	are	in	debt	and	there	is	need	to	enter	the	business	rehabilitation	process
business	rehabilitation	is	court	process
in	which	the	person	requesting	to	bring	the	case	to	the	court	separately	from	the	civil	case	or	ordinary	bankruptcy	cases	is	means	to	solve	economic	problems	and	financial	problems	of	receivables
so	the	debtor	can	manage	the	business	again	which	the	objective	of	the	business	rehabilitation	is	to	enable	the	debtor	business	to	continue	and	the	creditor	has	the	right	to	receive	more	debt	than	the	bankrupt	debtor	considering	the	problems	and	obstacles	of	debt	restructuring	most	smes	are	small	businesses
and	mostly	individuals	not	registered
therefore	the	opportunity	for	smes	to	enter	the	business	rehabilitation	process	therefore	almost	without	condition	the	condition	of	the	business	that	is	not	limited	company	or	public	limited	company
small	amount	of	capital	would	not	have	chance	to	have	debt	of	million
with	the	necessity	in	onwards	the	bankruptcy	act	issue
added	the	provisions	on	rehabilitation	of	small	and	medium	enterprise	business
in	summary	important	principles	regarding	business	rehabilitation	of	smes	are	as	follows	whether	an	individual	group	of	people	or	partnership	can	request	business	rehabilitation	if	having	the	characteristics	of	being	legally	smes	at	the	same	time	limited	company	if	having	the	characteristics	of	smes	then	have	the	right	to	apply	for	business	rehabilitation	as	smes	too
the	business	rehabilitation	process	of	smes	is	more	concise	than	the	normal	business	rehabilitation	process
because	if	rehabilitating	the	original	business	must	have	court	order	to	rehabilitate	the	business	first
will	then	begin	the	process	of	creating	and	managing	rehabilitation	plan
but	in	the	business	rehabilitation	of	smes	business	rehabilitation	plan	must	be	prepared	first
and	attached	to	the	request	for	business	rehabilitation
which	if	there	is	reason	for	the	business	rehabilitation	and	the	court	agreed	with	the	proposed	plan	the	court	will	issue	an	order	to	rehabilitate	and	agree	with	the	plan	and	lead	to	immediate	plan	management
define	the	definition	of	the	debtor
according	to	the	old	business	reorganization	law	debtor	means	limited	company	public	company	and	credit	union	cooperative	only
there	may	be	problems	in	the	rehabilitation	of	the	debtor	business	or	entrepreneurs	of	smes	because	smes	do	not	set	up	an	organization	like	company	only	but	there	are	individuals	ordinary	partnerships	unregistered	and	limited	partnership	who	is	eligible	to	apply	for	business	rehabilitation	for	smes
how	much	debt	is	available	to	the	business	rehabilitation	application
can	be	divided	into	the	following	cases	the	business	rehabilitation	process	of	smes	receivables	is	considered	to	help	solve	problems	for	debtors	experiencing	financial	liquidity	problems
to	have	the	opportunity	to	rehabilitate	the	business	and	not	being	bankrupt
in	order	to	preserve	the	business	organization	and	allowing	the	business	of	the	debtor	to	continue	in	which	the	creditor	will	receive	equal	pay	as	well	as	will	lead	to	positive	effect	on	overall	economic	stability	and	strengthening	the	potential	of	smes	by	aungwara	chaianong	for	sme
have	you	ever	bought	facebook	ads	to	boost	sales	but	the	outcome	doesnt	meet	expectations
what	is	the	cause	of	this	problem
scb	arranges	an	online	training	course	the	dots	digital	commerce	and	invites	khun	mantita	chinda	tip	guru	who	is	md	and	founder	of	digital	tips	academy	to	coach	smes	how	to	shoot	facebook	ads	and	to	study	the	facebook	algorithm	as	guideline	for	shooting	fb	ads	under	the	strategy
those	will	help	expand	the	customer	base	and	reach	the	right	target	customers	and	to	double	sales
facebook	ads	on	day	without	magic	many	say	that	we	should	not	bombard	the	advertising	budget	on	facebook	at	this	moment
shooting	ads	gradually	costs	more	and	wont	grow	sales	as	planned	moreover	competitors	pop	up	everywhere
khun	tip	suggests	we	look	at	the	exponential	growth	of	global	fb	users	especially	thai	fb	users	that	rank	no	in	the	world
that	means	our	customers	spend	most	of	their	time	on	fb
theres	saying	that	fish	where	the	fish	are	so	why	not	follow	our	customers
besides	fb	is	platform	prevailing	among	marketers
the	survey	shows	spend	advertising	budget	on	fb	which	means	its	still	an	effective	marketing	tool
in	fact	fb	would	work	as	long	as	entrepreneurs	can	penetrate	deeply	into	its	mechanical	for	the	utmost	benefit
khun	tip	emphasizes	that	fb	ad	is	only	powerful	tool	for	those	who	understand
why	shooting	facebook	ads	are	failing
even	though	some	people	think	that	money	can	always	buy	fb	ads	money	isnt	the	answer	for	the	winner	of	this	game
then	what	drives	success
khun	tip	suggests	that	we	look	back	to	the	following	factors	if	shooting	ads	dont	work	for	us
objective	know	the	objective	of	buying	ads	as	it	determines	mood	tone	and	the	outcome	or	how	the	ads	work	would	depend	on	the	set	objective
audience	if	ads	are	shot	at	the	wrong	target	itll	affect	advertising	effectiveness
creative	the	content	and	workpiece	must	hit	the	target	group	otherwise	it	cant	win	their	hearts
strategies	to	win	facebook	ads	shooting	game	khun	tip	refers	to	the	survey	that	people	are	likely	to	expose	to	around	ads	each	day
as	result	its	important	to	take	over	good	spots	on	fb	where	people	scroll	feeds	and	find	them	right	away
we	have	to	find	ways	and	make	sure	that	our	ads	will	appear	in	the	best	area	or	the	top	feeding	position
never	think	that	buying	ads	is	the	end	of	everything
understand	facebook	ads	algorithm	understand	how	facebook	algorithm	scores

tips	you	cant	win	fb	by	spending	much	or	little	money
what	matters	most	is	creating	ads	that	entice	viewers

campaign	choose	objectives	such	as	view	and	engagement

tips	things	to	remember	when	buying	fb	ads	campaign	can	have	multiple	ad	sets	and	ad	set	can	have	multiple	ads
dont	post	campaigns	too	often	as	the	ad	fee	is	expensive
setting	up	good	ad	structure	will	impact	creating	effective	ads

understand	facebook	ads	objective	when	buying	ads	choose	the	right	objective	under	different	categories	including	awareness	get	people	to	know	more	consideration	motivate	people	to	search	for	information	conversion	stimulate	someone	to	do	something
before	buying	ads	youd	better	foresee	whether	people	know	your	ads
if	they	dont	what	would	you	do	to	make	them	know
tips	select	old	target	group
just	change	the	objective	and	the	result	will	be	different
understand	facebook	ads	targeting	facebook	contains	types	of	target	audiences
core	audience	set	target	audience	independently	such	as	location	behavior	age	etc
the	accuracy	depends	on	how	much	you	know	customers
the	more	you	understand	them	the	more	precisely	your	target	is
those	who	are	adaptable	will	be	able	to	create	core	audiences	well
custom	audience	target	audiences	that	you	already	have	their	data	such	as	customer	list	or	fan	page
remarketing	is	suitable	for	those	who	are	using	an	app	which	means	creating	ads	for	following	people	who	used	to	engage	with	us
the	content	for	remarketing	ads	must	meet	customer	interest
for	instance	potential	customers	who	drop	on	selected	products	in	shopping	cart	but	dont	complete	the	purchase	and	then	the	ads	go	along	with	target	audiences	everywhere	to	accelerate	purchasing	decisions
lookalike	audience	find	new	target	audiences	who	have	similar	characteristics	to	existing	customers	data
nurture	leads	build	loyalty	with	facebook	custom	audiences	the	content	created	for	fb	custom	audiences	must	be	efficient	to	increase	followers	in	order	to	get	bigger	size	of	custom	audiences	and	cheaper	ad	fee
besides	it	also	generates	clv	customer	lifetime	value	which	means	customers	create	value	for	the	business	such	as	customers	repurchase	and	we	can	later	turn	them	into	brand	ambassadors
its	recommended	to	collect	customer	detailed	data	before	creating	content	so	that	you	will	truly	know	customers	while	implementing	fb	activities
expand	to	lookalike	audiences	expand	customer	base	with	lookalike	audiences
but	before	that	check	if	existing	customers	or	fan	page	really	match	our	business	target	audiences	and	there	must	be	enough	information	to	create	lookalike	audiences	effectively
get	super	granular	with	layered	targeting	options	narrow	down	target	audiences	such	as	selling	shirts	made	of	natural	resources
apart	from	selecting	target	audiences	who	are	interested	in	shirts	you	should	also	dig	into	people	who	are	eco	friendly	or	care	about	sustainability
however	remember	that	narrowing	target	audiences	will	cause	higher	advertising	fees
anyway	if	it	grows	sales	then	its	worth	more	than	paying	for	broad	targeting
get	creative	with	life	events	targeting	identify	target	audiences	from	life	events	like	selling	furniture
find	out	which	group	will	buy	new	furniture	such	as	couple	who	is	getting	married
leverage	location	targeting	create	target	audiences	from	locations	such	as	people	who	live	in	this	location	people	who	are	traveling	along	with	this	location	etc
develop	full	funnel	strategy	generally	customers	must	see	ads	many	times	before	making	purchasing	decision
thus	starting	from	building	an	awareness	before	shooting	ads
at	first	producing	ads	that	spark	customer	interest	to	build	awareness	followed	by	ads	that	create	consideration	to	provide	information	and	get	customers	to	know	products	more	ending	up	with	creating	conversion	ads	to	trigger	them	to	make	purchasing	decisions
before	turning	pro	to	win	facebook	ads	shooting	game	youd	better	understand	the	main	factors	of	buying	objective	select	clear	target	audiences	in	line	with	the	business	produce	great	ads	study	fb	algorithm	as	key	to	find	appropriate	techniques	in	shooting	ads

covid	has	negative	impact	on	variety	of	global	industries	and	one	of	them	is	the	food	business
if	you	dont	give	up	and	see	an	opportunity	covid	may	be	opening	the	door	to	new	business	that	can	generate	growth
this	article	shares	true	example	happening	in	tokyo	where	covid	has	affected	the	eating	behavior	of	people	who	are	dining	out	much	less	than	ever
many	restaurants	close	down	both	temporarily	and	permanently	because	people	are	eating	at	home	instead
customers	also	visit	supermarkets	less	often	to	buy	fruits	and	vegetables
the	reason	is	tokyo	has	high	proportion	of	elderly	citizens	so	they	are	much	worried	about	leaving	home	and	it	risks	their	lives	if	they	are	infectious
the	situation	has	affected	fruit	and	vegetable	wholesalers
they	used	to	deliver	over	categories	per	day	to	big	and	small	restaurants	including	supermarkets	in	tokyo	for	more	than	years
effects	of	the	covid	have	dramatically	reduced	sales	so	many	wholesalers	are	finding	new	ways	to	survive
they	have	shifted	wholesale	to	home	delivery	but	there	is	limitation	because	wholesaling	companies	never	have	any	experience	in	product	delivery	to	consumers
thus	wholesalers	have	joined	hands	with	local	newspaper	senders	who	deliver	newspapers	to	households	every	morning	in	their	control	zone
the	wholesalers	ask	newspaper	agents	to	deliver	fruits	and	vegetables	to	consumers	directly	as	they	are	familiar	with	the	area	and	houses	in	the	community
besides	the	newspaper	agents	normally	finish	their	job	within	so	they	can	manage	the	rest	of	the	day	to	deliver	fruits	and	vegetables	right	away
consumers	just	tell	the	location	and	the	newspaper	agent	will	deliver	fresh	products	to	them	the	same	day
both	parties	have	cooperated	with	each	other	to	create	an	order	form	that	consumers	can	easily	pick	their	favorite	products	for	example	sheet	list	of	seasonal	fruits	and	vegetables	with	their	price	in	big	letters	attached	with	newspaper	and	then	customers	can	make	an	order	by	scanning	qr	code
when	wholesalers	receive	orders	they	will	select	premium	fruits	and	vegetables	and	place	them	in	one	box	per	order	and	then	deliver	all	boxes	to	the	newspaper	agent
the	agent	will	recheck	the	quality	of	products	and	pack	them	before	delivering	and	also	enclose	the	seasonal	fruits	and	veggies	recipes
those	practices	have	enabled	the	wholesalers	to	minimize	delivery	costs	and	increase	large	number	of	sales	while	the	newspaper	agents	have	also	gained	more	income	by	utilizing	existing	resources	and	skills
elderly	consumers	who	try	to	avoid	going	to	crowded	areas	like	supermarkets	are	happy	as	they	are	already	familiar	with	the	newspaper	senders	and	they	are	able	to	get	fresh	products	by	the	same	day	delivery
that	model	has	been	tremendously	well	received
there	is	huge	number	of	orders	coming	in	and	other	types	of	products	like	meat	or	flowers	want	to	follow
we	see	that	the	adaptation	strategy	of	fruit	and	vegetable	wholesalers	is	not	complicated	at	all
try	to	stop	repetitive	thoughts	and	find	out	business	partners	in	your	area	who	can	fulfill	your	objectives
all	parties	will	win	and	consumers	will	get	fresh	products	by	fast	service
keep	improving	and	make	your	customer	demands	your	first	priority	and	then	your	business	can	get	over	the	crisis	and	continue	to	grow

the	global	health	crisis	which	led	to	the	global	economic	crisis
diseases	that	cause	the	whole	world	to	shake	until	leading	to	change
both	in	individual	behavior	the	overall	change	of	society	and	more	importantly	the	impact	on	the	economy	around	the	world
since	the	tourism	industry	and	related	industries	including	cancellation	of	flights	hotels	and	activities	including	production	degradation	in	industries	around	the	world	that	are	under	the	global	value	chain
which	will	continue	to	affect	both	domestic	and	international	trade	and	investment
people	also	must	pay	for	the	prevention	of	infection
confined	to	the	house	resulting	in	lack	of	income	until	spread	to	the	occurrence	of	stress	and	mental	health	problems	followed
in	addition	in	the	financial	sector	it	also	affects	the	global	stock	market	fall
including	many	countries	choosing	to	close	the	country	which	causes	severe	economic	recession
but	this	is	not	the	first	crisis	that	destroys	the	global	economy
since	the	past	years	the	world	has	experienced	trembling	shaking	of	the	global	economy	many	times
today	we	will	study	the	history	traces	of	global	economic	trauma	as	reminder	that	everything	has	going	up	and	down
and	to	encourage	me	that	how	strong	is	human	being
but	still	able	to	stand	strong	every	time
the	great	depression	the	great	depression	began	in	the	united	states	in	the	which	is	known	to	be	wide	economic	disaster
for	long	time	and	one	of	the	deepest	destructions	in	the	economy	in	the	th	century
the	incident	had	triggered	by	the	us	stock	market	that	had	fallen	heavily	since	september	becoming	the	worldwide	news	known	as	black	tuesday
during	the	years	global	gdp	fell	by	more	than	whether	rich	or	poor	countries	were	affected	all	over
both	people	income	tax	revenue	business	results	and	the	prices	of	the	products	were	falling	apart
international	trading	volume	decreased	by	more	than
the	unemployment	rate	in	the	united	states	itself	has	risen	to	while	some	countries	have	unemployment	as	high	as
the	country	that	has	been	heavily	affected	will	be	country	that	should	lead	to	industrial	systems	for	production	and	mining	while	agricultural	countries	are	also	affected	by	the	price	of	agricultural	products	falling	below
the	impact	of	the	great	depression	stretched	through	to	the	beginning	of	world	war	ii
the	suez	crisis	the	suez	canal	connects	the	mediterranean	sea	and	the	red	sea
the	isthmus	in	suez	egypt	which	is	the	shortcut	route	for	shipping	from	europe	to	asia
the	suez	crisis	or	the	second	israeli	arab	war	or	another	name	is	the	sinai	war	in	israel
was	an	invasion	of	egypt	in	late	by	isara	followed	by	england	and	france
the	aim	is	to	control	the	west	side	of	the	suez	canal	and	to	dismiss	the	president	of	egypt	who	said	has	the	right	to	turn	that	canal	to	belong	to	the	state
after	the	battle	began	all	three	countries	who	participated	in	the	war	received	political	pressure	from	the	united	states	and	the	soviet	union
including	the	united	nations
until	leading	to	the	withdrawal	by	all	three	invaders
it	is	great	shame	for	the	united	kingdom	and	france
although	allies	of	the	three	countries	have	achieved	military	goals	the	canal	has	become	unusable
us	president	eisenhower	warned	england	that	it	shouldn	be	compromised	and	threatens	to	seriously	damage	the	british	financial	system	by	selling	off	the	pound	sterling	held	by	the	united	states
england	faced	heavy	currency	fluctuations	from	currency	gainers
at	that	time	the	pound	against	the	us	dollar	was	at	but	volatility	made	it	hard	to	keep	the	currency	at	that	level	until	it	needed	to	ask	for	help	from	the	united	states	for	billion	to	support	the	pound
france	also	suffered	from	currency	fluctuations	and	had	to	borrow	million	from	the	united	states	to	maintain	economic	stability
egypt	must	borrow	twice	from	the	imf
israel	joins	the	imf	and	must	borrow	to	maintain	economic	stability	as	well
after	this	war	the	british	superpowers	have	decreased	from	tier	to	tier	the	international	debt	crisis	the	international	debt	crisis	was	formed	on	august	and	lasted	until	affecting	over	countries	around	the	world
in	eastern	europe	the	countries	that	were	heavily	affected	were	poland	roman	catalonia	hungary	yugoslavia
as	for	other	countries	the	most	affected	are	latin	american	countries
the	cause	of	the	crisis	occurred	in	the	when	latin	american	countries	such	as	brazil	argentina	and	mexico	have	borrowed	large	amounts	of	money	from	international	creditors	or	private	banks
which	at	that	time	had	an	enormous	amount	of	money	to	borrow	and	low	interest	due	to	receiving	large	deposits	from	the	oil	exporting	countries
therefore	lend	cheap	interest	to	developing	countries	because	they	saw	the	potential	and	the	economy	was	growing	both	eastern	european	countries	and	latin	american	countries
most	of	them	request	loans	for	industrial	development	projects	and	various	utility	construction	projects
because	at	that	time	these	developing	countries	had	economic	growth	in	an	uptrend
private	banks	therefore	lend	with	pleasure
in	which	many	countries	use	loans	up	to	of	the	national	income
in	truth	developing	countries	usually	borrow	money	from	international	organizations	such	as	the	world	bank	or	the	imf	and	do	not	borrow	from	private	creditors
mexico	uses	future	oil	revenue	as	loan	in	us	dollars
but	the	results	show	that	the	price	of	oil	has	plummeted	along	with	the	economy	of	mexico	that	plummeted	into	the	abyss
between	and	the	debt	of	private	banks	from	latin	american	countries	increased	to	of	the	total	debt
which	has	debt	value	of	up	to	us	billion	and	increased	to	billion	in	in	debt	accounts	for	up	to	of	the	region	gdp
and	in	the	end	these	countries	announced	that	they	had	no	money	to	repay	the	loan	which	resulted	in	prolonged	debt	problem	until	the	east	asian	crisis	this	crisis	has	big	impact	on	the	countries	of	east	asia	and	southeast	asia	and	causing	concern	for	the	whole	world	that	the	economy	was	going	down
the	beginning	of	the	crisis	occurred	in	thailand	or	better	known	as	tom	yum	kung	the	incident	began	on	july	when	the	thai	government	was	forced	to	float	the	baht	because	the	country	lacked	other	currency	reserves	especially	us	dollars	in	order	to	support	the	baht
which	causes	immediate	economic	impacts
in	fact	before	the	floating	of	the	baht	the	thai	government	already	has	lot	of	foreign	debt
the	impact	of	thailand	expanding	into	southeast	asia	and	east	asia
that	must	face	the	currency	slump	including	the	stock	market	that	plummeted	abyss	and	higher	household	debt
the	most	affected	country	is	thailand
indonesia	and	south	korea	while	hong	kong	laos	malaysia	and	the	philippines	were	also	injured
while	brunei	china	singapore	taiwan	and	vietnam	are	less	affected
for	japan	although	not	much	affected	it	was	affected	because	the	whole	world	lacked	confidence	in	all	the	countries	in	this	region
asean	countries	have	debt	to	gdp	rates	from	to	and	up	to	during	the	peak	of	the	crisis
the	russian	crisis	the	russian	financial	crisis	also	known	as	the	ruble	currency	crisis	that	struck	russia	heavily
the	event	started	on	august	the	government	and	the	russian	central	bank	announced	the	ruble	devaluation
as	some	russian	oil	companies	are	blocked	from	paying	debts	in	rubles
causing	to	have	to	exchange	rubles	for	us	dollars	or	other	currencies	because	before	the	ruble	was	very	expensive	compared	to	other	currencies
another	reason	that	caused	the	crisis	was	that	the	country	annual	debt	to	budget	ratio	increased	because	of	the	chechya	war	which	has	reached	billion
the	crisis	has	affected	many	neighboring	countries
on	may	miners	protested	that	they	were	not	paid	and	closed	the	railway	trans	siberian	line
which	the	wage	debt	that	is	not	paid	for	workers	is	as	high	as	billion
on	july	the	imf	and	world	bank	approved	billion	loan	with	russia	to	recover	the	economy
in	july	the	interest	in	russian	monthly	loans	increased	to	which	is	even	higher	than	the	tax	collected	by	the	country
the	great	recession	the	great	recession	is	period	of	global	economic	downturn	between	the	severity	of	the	crisis	varies	from	country	to	country
the	imf	said	the	great	recession	has	been	one	of	the	worst	economic	losses	since	the	great	depression	in	there	were	many	common	factors	that	led	to	great	recession	but	the	main	event	that	triggered	the	bomb	was	the	housing	bubble	in	the	united	states	during	causing	the	real	estate	prices	in	america	to	drop	dramatically	and	many	home	loan	receivables	abandoned	the	house	and	stopped	paying	home	installments	because	the	value	of	the	loan	is	much	higher	than	the	price	of	the	house	at	that	time
causing	massive	amounts	of	bad	debts	also	known	as	the	subprime	mortgage	crisis
us	gpd	decreased	by	resulting	in	decreased	ability	of	americans	to	consume	and	that	affected	the	global	economy
resulting	in	global	gdp	growth	down	from	in	to	in	the	imf	estimates	that	bad	debts	of	financial	institutions	around	the	world	are	at	theus	billion	oil	prices	fall	by	more	than
the	situation	stretches	until	and	affects	the	global	economy
the	european	crisis	european	public	debt	crisis	occurred	at	the	end	of	long	standing	debt	crisis	in	eu	member	states
many	countries	include	greece	portugal	ireland	spain	and	cyprus
these	countries	could	not	repay	the	debt	that	the	government	created	or	created	new	debt	to	repay	the	old	debt	without	the	help	of	external	parties	such	as	the	european	monetary	fund	efsf	the	european	central	bank	ecb	and	the	imf
fear	of	public	debt	crisis	started	among	investors	this	is	result	of	the	increase	in	debt	levels	in	the	private	and	public	sectors	around	the	world
the	causes	of	the	crisis	vary	across	countries
in	many	countries	liabilities	are	caused	by	the	transfer	of	private	debt	from	real	estate	bubbles	to	public	debt
by	providing	financial	assistance	to	the	banking	system	to	slow	the	economy	after	the	government	bubble	burst
the	structure	of	the	european	union	that	is	financial	union	single	currency	without	the	finance	union	tax	rules	and	public	pensions	are	different
contributed	to	the	crisis	and	making	european	leaders	unable	to	solve	problems
in	greece	there	were	many	homeless	people	standing	in	line	waiting	to	receive	food
many	seniors	waiting	for	pensions	commit	suicide	or	sick	but	unable	to	receive	treatment	or	even	receive	medication
many	stores	must	close
young	people	under	are	unemployed
all	due	to	the	enormous	amount	of	public	debt
the	country	budget	depends	entirely	on	borrowing
which	is	caused	by	the	failed	state	administration	business	weakness	and	high	inflation
as	for	other	countries	such	as	portugal	before	joining	the	eu	they	had	low	per	capita	incomes
when	joining	the	eu	they	began	to	borrow	and	spend	more
and	is	another	country	in	europe	that	has	the	highest	public	debt	and	household	debt
from	the	example	of	the	global	economic	crisis	uncertainty	is	certainty
and	financial	discipline	not	creating	indebtedness	is	an	important	issue
as	small	citizen	also	what	we	can	do	is	to	make	and	save
discipline	in	spending	and	know	to	invest	appropriately

but	even	though	aunty	maew	is	in	her	sixties	being	rider	with	the	robinhood	app	allows	her	to	live	with	purpose	once	more
used	to	work	as	pharmacy	manager	in	department	store
when	turned	the	store	went	out	of	business	and	let	me	go
at	my	age	no	one	will	accept	me	for	the	same	job	position
was	jobless	until	saw	robinhood	recruiting	riders	so	came	and	applied
having	the	opportunity	to	unwind	at	home	after	decades	of	hard	work	might	appear	to	be	good	thing
but	that	not	the	case	for	aunty	maew
stayed	at	home	and	did	nothing
felt	bad	and	worthless
when	went	to	see	doctor	he	said	it	was	an	early	sign	of	depression
but	once	started	working	with	robinhood	felt	lot	better
aunty	maew	loves	her	independence	and	enjoys	going	out
being	robinhood	rider	is	the	ideal	answer	for	bringing	her	back	to	life
when	leave	home	it	like	setting	bird	free	she	exclaimed
aunty	maew	said	she	chose	to	work	with	robinhood	because	of	the	benefits	provided	to	riders	by	the	app	such	as	accident	insurance
aside	from	that	riders	get	paid	every	day	so	they	have	money	in	their	accounts	to	spend	and	do	not	have	to	advance	payments	for	customers
if	there	is	problem	call	center	is	available	to	assist	and	provide	information
however	not	everything	went	smoothly	at	first
despite	the	fact	that	aunty	maew	has	been	riding	motorcycles	since	she	was	young	driving	in	bangkok	streets	is	difficult	and	aunty	maew	main	challenge	was	using	technology
aunty	maew	struggled	to	use	the	gps	map	system	when	she	first	started	as	she	had	no	idea	how	to	switch	app	screens
she	now	demonstrates	her	mobile	phone	sliding	skill	to	open	various	apps	with	ease	demonstrating	that	age	is	not	an	impediment	to	starting	something	new
we	will	not	learn	if	we	are	afraid
years	old	and	ve	never	stopped	learning
believe	that	age	is	not	barrier	to	learning
throughout	our	lives	there	is	always	something	new	to	learn
it	is	not	difficult	to	use	the	robinhood	app
we	should	be	open	to	new	information
robinhood	also	offers	service	etiquette	training	and	has	call	center	team	to	assist	riders
usually	follow	and	read	information	and	problems	shared	on	line	groups	from	various	zones
so	have	good	idea	of	what	going	on	and	how	to	solve	problems
my	work	ethic	since	working	at	the	drugstore	has	been	that	you	don	repeat	the	same	mistake
you	must	learn	and	close	any	gaps
sometimes	if	its	impossible	to	avoid	mistakes	you	must	accept	them	and	move	on	with	the	best	solution
that	is	the	way	to	enjoy	working	aunty	maew	said
aunty	maew	takes	also	full	advantage	of	high	performance	working	equipment
although	it	costs	more	aunty	maew	sees	it	as	an	investment	to	help	her	work	better
use	good	quality	mobile	phone	with	strong	internet	signal	to	ensure	that	can	receive	orders	quickly
some	riders	complain	that	they	can	accept	orders
they	should	upgrade	their	device	and	internet	signal	to	get	more	orders	and	so	their	cell	phone	signal	wont	drop	out	when	calling	customers
sometimes	we	have	to	invest	more	to	make	our	services	work	out	well	working	as	robinhood	rider	is	joy	in	aunty	maew	life	and	her	family	is	supportive
my	two	children	have	stable	jobs	and	are	willing	to	take	care	of	me
but	want	to	earn	income	to	cover	my	own	expenses
they	understand	that	it	makes	me	happy
they	want	me	to	remain	fit	and	strong	to	keep	on	working	apart	from	delivering	food	aunty	maew	also	advises	others	to	sell	delivery	food
they	dont	need	to	open	shops	they	can	sell	it	on	the	application
met	friend	from	workshop	went	to
she	didnt	earn	any	income
so	advised	her	to	try	selling	delivery	food	as	she	can	do	it	at	home	without	storefront
she	already	has	internet	at	home
in	the	beginning	she	had	her	children	help	her	with	the	app	and	now	she	can	use	it	all	by	herself	robinhood	is	an	app	for	small	players
it	helps	create	jobs
not	charging	gp	fees	helps	both	eateries	and	riders	while	customers	can	enjoy	lower	prices	with	the	same	quality	as	served	at	stores	and	restaurants	from	aunty	maew	point	of	view	her	impression	of	the	robinhood	application	is	that	it	is	an	app	developed	by	big	bank	made	by	thai	people	for	thai	people
im	trying	to	seize	opportunities
ive	never	been	disappointed	with	robinhood
will	be	with	robinhood	until	the	day	can	no	longer	ride
this	app	gives	me	lot
apart	from	money	its	the	joy	of	working	to	deliver	food	to	customers	and	adding	value	to	my	life	summed	up	aunty	maew	robinhood	rider	whos	too	young	at	heart	to	retire
normally	during	the	long	vacations	rayong	would	have	visitors	from	almost	every	city	including	residents	of	rayong	themselves
they	would	come	to	enjoy	the	sea	appreciate	nature	stroll	the	old	market	visit	the	museum	taste	delicious	durians	at	the	orchard	try	fresh	seafood	and	shop	local	souvenirs	for	friends	and	family
however	after	the	news	about	covid	infected	egyptian	soldiers	entering	the	area	came	out	the	business	that	was	recovering	from	the	outbreak	of	the	pandemic	came	to	recession	once	again
the	spread	of	the	rumors	brought	the	whole	country	to	panic
in	this	article	anuchida	chinsiraprapha	president	of	rayong	chamber	of	commerce	and	owner	of	golden	city	rayong	hotel	will	decode	lessons	from	crisis	management	the	handling	of	situations	that	are	hard	to	control	as	well	as	the	readiness	of	rayong	that	is	safe	and	clean	and	is	prepared	to	welcome	tourists
persist	and	determine	to	follow	the	dreams	during	tom	yum	kung	crisis	amidst	the	plummeting	economy	baht	depreciation	and	bankruptcy	of	many	business	and	financial	institutions	hotel	located	right	in	the	heart	of	city	of	rayong	still	continued	their	construction	to	open	the	business
that	hotel	was	golden	city	rayong	hotel
anuchida	shared	that	more	than	years	ago	there	were	not	many	big	hotels	in	rayong	and	the	price	was	relatively	high
other	hotels	would	be	made	out	of	shophouses
there	were	not	medium	or	small	hotels	available	as	options
anuchida	thus	thought	of	building	small	hotel	in	budget	hotel	style
initially	her	family	disagreed
but	anuchida	did	not	falter	and	her	husband	agreed	to	let	her	build	hotel	at	the	end	under	condition	that	it	should	not	burden	the	family
after	approval	from	her	husband	anuchida	immediately	moved	forward	to	chase	her	dream
she	used	plot	of	land	next	to	sukhumvit	road	that	was	planned	to	build	house	for	her	family	to	build	hotel
however	during	the	construction	due	to	her	lack	of	experience	the	contractor	left	the	site	unfinished
anuchida	thus	had	to	be	responsible	for	the	debt	of	metals	and	other	materials	that	cost	almost	million	baht
despite	careful	calculation	and	financial	plan	with	only	loan	to	avoid	excessive	debt	but	with	the	financial	crisis	there	was	almost	million	baht	debt
it	was	rough	start	for	woman	in	her	that	she	had	to	decide	alone	and	do	almost	everything	by	herself
nevertheless	anuchida	did	not	give	in	to	destiny
she	thought	that	if	the	economy	was	bad	customers	who	used	to	stay	in	big	hotel	would	move	to	stay	in	smaller	hotels	to	save	money
if	the	economy	was	good	smaller	hotels	would	also	become	choices	for	customers
when	there	was	mistake	or	crisis	smaller	hotels	would	be	able	to	survive	and	pay	the	debt
eventually	anuchida	survived	all	of	that	with	persistence	determination	and	financial	discipline
it	allowed	her	to	pay	the	debt	quickly	and	continue	her	business	with	stability
start	business	during	sunken	economy	change	crisis	to	opportunity	january	was	an	opening	date	of	golden	city	rayong	hotel
customers	continuously	came	to	stay	in	the	hotel	because	tom	yum	kung	crisis	pulled	the	economy	down	that	customers	chose	accommodation	that	could	save	more	money	as	predicted
in	the	beginning	the	hotel	focused	on	customers	who	would	stay	for	long	period	of	time	especially	japanese	employees	who	came	to	install	machinery	and	technology
there	were	few	korean	customers	and	later	on	the	hotel	gained	thai	businesspeople	and	engineers	from	various	factories	as	customers
when	guests	went	out	to	work	the	hotel	would	open	windows	in	the	rooms	to	air	the	room	allowing	the	air	to	ventilate	in	the	room
as	for	the	beds	bed	sheets	would	be	taken	off	to	wash	or	air	the	bed
the	hotel	has	been	following	the	ritual	for	more	than	years
also	all	rooms	would	have	safety	boxes	available
if	it	was	room	for	long	term	stay	there	would	be	sink	installed	for	simple	food	preparation
there	was	research	on	customers	before	designing	the	rooms	to	fit	and	answer	the	demands	of	different	groups	of	customers	that	the	hotel	was	acknowledged	on	hygiene	convenience	and	safety
as	for	public	relations	of	the	hotel	anuchida	had	done	very	little	on	advertisements	because	she	wanted	the	hotel	to	sell	itself
she	emphasized	more	on	customer	service	and	cleanliness	that	the	hotel	made	good	impressions	on	customers	and	the	reputation	of	the	hotel	spread	through	word	of	mouth
when	the	hotel	was	trusted	by	customers	anuchida	further	developed	the	hotel	so	that	customers	would	continue	to	spread	the	news
and	when	the	business	is	stable	enough	she	would	gradually	expand	the	hotel	while	anticipating	the	future	economy	all	together
change	for	growth	when	the	domestic	economy	started	to	revive	there	were	more	people	entering	the	manufacturing	industry
more	hotels	apartments	and	houses	were	opened	in	accordance	with	the	rising	demand
golden	city	rayong	hotel	also	expanded	from	small	hotel	on	square	meters	plot	of	land	to	hotel	with	an	area	of	square	metres	in	the	present
there	are	more	buildings	for	accommodation	and	for	seminars
anuchida	therefore	had	to	think	about	the	direction	of	her	service	strategy	because	solely	providing	accommodations	will	force	her	to	compete	in	the	market	share	with	other	hotels
she	then	decided	to	change	the	hotel	to	become	hotel	for	seminars
she	decreased	the	ratio	of	long	term	stay	customers	as	well	as	increased	facilities	and	equipment	for	seminars
this	makes	the	majority	of	customers	to	be	customers	to	stay	for	the	seminar
seminar	groups	came	with	limited	budget	and	they	mainly	used	the	accommodation
to	construct	new	building	the	size	of	the	rooms	would	have	to	be	bigger	to	accommodate	customers	that	wish	to	stay	as	people	in	room	and	every	room	would	come	with	working	table
the	profit	per	customer	was	considered	low	because	in	every	seminar	there	would	require	electricians	sound	technicians	receptionists	and	cleaners
moreover	there	were	more	leftovers	and	waste
equipment	like	projector	was	high	in	cost	and	has	limited	lifespan
the	challenge	of	the	hotel	is	thus	to	attempt	to	gain	enough	customers	to	prevent	any	loss
at	the	same	time	the	hotel	cannot	neglect	cleanliness	that	is	the	core	standard	of	the	hotel
strength	of	golden	city	rayong	operating	business	alongside	the	society	is	the	strength	of	golden	city	rayong	hotel
apart	from	being	the	owner	of	the	hotel	and	president	of	the	rayong	chamber	of	commerce	anuchida	is	also	the	president	of	pracharath	rak	samakkee	company
she	thus	tried	to	help	the	community	by	purchasing	local	products	and	used	them	in	the	hotel
there	was	zone	for	local	stores	to	display	and	sell	their	products	within	the	hotel	that	helped	to	generate	profit	for	the	community
during	the	covid	crisis	the	hotel	purchased	local	products	in	the	community	to	replenish	the	sharing	box	to	help	those	who	were	in	need
besides	anuchida	thought	of	how	to	reduce	waste	by	making	fertilization	for	organic	vegetables	that	were	grown	for	the	hotel	out	of	daily	leftover	food
it	is	agriculture	that	employees	help	to	take	care	and	grow	in	order	to	know	the	value	of	what	they	are	doing	and	know	how	each	type	of	vegetable	is	grown
also	customers	will	get	to	eat	clean	and	safe	organic	vegetables
even	the	hotels	famous	dessert	like	golden	roll	is	made	from	bread	with	banana	jam	and	cream	filling	fried	till	golden	brown
anyone	who	gets	to	try	will	ask	for	the	second
the	banana	used	in	that	dessert	is	grown	by	the	hotel
there	was	lecturer	who	came	for	the	seminar
they	saw	the	bananas	and	said	that	they	were	beautiful
so	they	asked	the	employees	where	these	bananas	were	bought	from
when	they	knew	that	bananas	were	grown	by	the	hotel	they	asked	if	they	could	have	photo	of	the	banana	trees
another	group	of	customers	came	to	hold	their	wedding	ceremony
the	hotel	can	create	any	kind	of	ceremony	as	clients	wish	that	is	unlike	any	other
the	hotel	has	large	area	that	could	accommodate	up	to	round	tables	with	recommended	dishes	such	as	braised	fish	maw	in	red	gravy	hong	kong	noodles	hot	and	tender	pork	knuckle	and	shark	fin	that	the	hotel	keeps	and	prepared	to	ensure	that	customers	get	to	eat	clean	and	chemical	free	food
measures	against	covid	situation	after	the	government	announced	lockdown	policy	as	measure	to	contain	the	spread	of	covid	hotels	across	the	country	are	affected
some	hotels	had	to	temporarily	close	to	avoid	the	lack	of	capital	because	of	the	expense	and	income
however	anuchida	decided	not	to	close	the	hotel	because	there	were	still	long	stay	guests	that	were	working	in	the	city	and	they	could	not	leave	at	about	rooms
closing	the	hotel	means	deserting	the	customers
anuchida	considered	customers	as	benefactors
despite	the	hotel	going	through	hard	time	it	had	to	be	opened
staff	themselves	also	played	their	parts	to	help	the	organisation
they	took	turns	to	work	to	reduce	costs
for	staff	who	were	in	need	anuchida	would	find	them	jobs	ranging	from	renovations	big	cleaning	and	gardening	so	that	everybody	could	survive	this	hardship	together
having	financial	discipline	and	having	gone	through	difficult	situations	since	the	establishment	of	the	hotel	anuchida	led	her	life	and	business	carefully
if	she	had	to	loan	money	for	business	expansion	she	would	not	overuse	the	money	not	use	it	for	the	wrong	purpose	and	repay	as	soon	as	possible	so	that	when	crisis	happened	she	would	not	have	to	face	difficulty
apart	from	that	anuchida	encouraged	and	shared	lessons	with	entrepreneurs	that	are	affected	by	the	spread	of	covid
she	shared	that	they	should	be	strong	and	careful	because	crises	could	always	happen
do	not	only	look	at	opportunities	or	the	positive	side	of	the	business	but	anticipate	the	consequences	of	unstable	growth
this	will	help	to	reduce	loss
decode	rayong	lesson	raise	awareness	remain	calm	originally	rayong	people	are	not	working	in	the	manufacturing	industry	but	they	will	mainly	work	in	the	service	industry	and	restaurants
their	income	thus	increases	and	decreases	according	to	the	number	of	tourists	and	the	national	economy
news	about	covid	infected	egyptian	soldier	entering	rayong	put	break	to	the	revival	of	the	city
it	was	clearly	shown	that	many	restaurants	and	residences	were	canceled
the	area	that	was	still	able	to	attract	visitors	was	koh	samet
however	with	safe	distancing	policy	koh	samet	could	only	accommodate	up	to	of	what	they	usually	could
hotel	business	had	quite	high	cost	at	around	or	more
when	there	were	very	few	tourists	entering	the	city	the	business	could	not	survive
so	rayong	people	would	have	to	help	one	another	to	use	the	local	service
in	some	resorts	there	were	more	than	of	rayong	customers
this	shown	that	rayong	people	attempted	to	establish	trust	within	their	own	city
the	surprise	of	covid	news	is	lesson	that	should	be	thought	thoroughly
so	that	history	will	not	repeat	itself	from	unclear	communication	that	news	recipients	did	not	know	what	is	true	and	what	is	not
anuchida	shared	about	the	way	to	communicate	sensitive	matters	from	rayong	model	as	followed	rayong	is	city	with	about	hundred	kilometre	coastline
however	each	beach	will	have	different	styles	of	lodges	to	select
their	attractions	would	be	fresh	seafood	at	an	affordable	price	beautiful	beaches	and	crystal	clear	seas	pak	nam	prasae	area	that	people	can	cycle	to	view	the	local	community	old	towns	museums	and	many	old	markets	to	visit
during	the	fruits	season	there	is	agricultural	tourism	that	is	organized	for	tourists	to	buy	fresh	fruits	right	in	the	orchard
there	are	also	up	to	restaurants	with	delicious	food	that	are	guaranteed	by	the	rayong	chamber	of	commerce
moreover	there	is	race	organized	by	government	and	private	organizations
there	are	city	races	orchard	races	as	well	as	nature	races
for	entertainment	enthusiasts	stay	tuned	for	news	on	samet	in	love	music	festival	by	the	sea	which	might	be	organized	once	again
and	for	food	lovers	rayong	will	be	an	answer	that	can	be	visited	whole	year	long
today	rayong	is	ready	to	grow	stably
it	will	be	city	that	will	cross	peoples	minds	when	they	are	planning	on	their	next	trip
picture	from	citation	scb	tv	episode	decode	the	lesson	of	rayong	crisis	path	to	place	that	people	can	visit	every	day	by	anuchida	chinsiraprapha	president	of	rayong	chamber	of	commerce	and	owner	of	golden	city	rayong	hotel
for	sme	pin	the	shop	for	customers	to	find
in	the	business	world	achieving	success	is	not	just	education	in	textbooks	but	experiences	that	come	from	doing	trial	and	error	being	heated	and	cold	in	various	situations
the	dots	hotel	game	changer	course	by	scb	sme	has	organized	the	session	sharing	thoughts	and	business	experience
invited	khun	ditthawat	issara	assistant	managing	director	charn	issara	development	pcl	khun	sarun	limsawaswong	from	sukhumvit	hoteland	khun	jarujit	baiyoke	assistant	president	baiyoke	group	successful	business	people	come	to	share	experiences	that	hoteliers	need	to	know
hotel	business	routes	khun	ditthawat	or	khun	platu	told	about	the	origin	of	sri	panwa	that	arose	from	the	idea	of	khun	plawan	worasit	issara	the	oldest	brother	who	graduated	in	hotel	management	from	switzerland
he	wanted	to	develop	beautiful	land	in	phuket	to	be	super	luxury	hotel	instead	of	the	family	real	estate	project
starting	from	the	small	scale	from	villas	years	ago
in	which	khun	platu	helped	to	oversee	the	marketing	activities	of	sri	panwa	and	see	the	growth	from	villas	to	and	villas	in	which	sri	panwa	will	open	new	phase	soon
sri	panwa	will	open	new	phase	soon
khun	sarun	limsawaswong	or	khun	nueng	owner	of	the	group	hotel	spoke	of	starting	hotel	business	years	ago	with	dream	to	build	small	hotel	which	started	with	the	room	hotel	business
started	from	the	first	step	since	never	making	hotel	until	expanding	the	business	to	hotels	totaling	over	rooms
khun	jarujit	baiyoke	or	khun	bum	used	to	study	culinary	studies	from	le	cordon	bleu	and	started	the	family	business	of	the	baiyoke	hotel
and	then	proceeded	to	run	the	hua	chang	heritage	luxury	segment	hotel	that	khun	bum	is	good	at
the	important	mindset	is	passion	ask	and	listen	for	khun	neung	viewpoint	the	idea	of	being	hotel	man	is	passionate	and	fun	way	to	open	every	new	hotel
when	knowing	more	about	customers	hotel	products	became	even	clearer	and	expanded	the	market	even	more
khun	nueng	started	working	at	the	hotel	when	she	was	years	old
she	recruited	employees	who	are	older	and	more	experienced	which	is	considered	useful	to	learn	dozens	of	experiences	years	from	them
however	it	must	be	clear	and	decide	for	yourself
khun	bum	said	about	adjusting	the	mindset	when	starting	into	the	family	business	that	having	to	adjust	the	mindset	lot	from	what	thought	saw	lot	and	was	not	satisfied	with	anything
and	when	doing	the	campaign	but	not	being	successful	began	to	understand	that	if	she	didn	know	anything	asked	the	elders	who	had	done	it	in	front	of	the	job	and	were	successful
not	just	looking	at	data	from	numbers	on	paper	and	the	key	is	to	throw	the	ego	out	admitting	that	there	is	someone	better	than	yourself
do	not	think	that	you	are	better	than	them
the	seniors	and	employees	will	feel	that	we	are	the	same	team
it	is	not	just	the	daughter	of	the	owners	who	walked	and	demand	even	without	knowing	anything
and	if	the	employees	have	any	problems	they	will	come	and	talk	to	us
same	as	khun	platu	look	at	passion	asking	questions	listening	is	important	in	management
khun	platu	story	it	is	family	business	that	has	changed	from	generation	to	the	new	generation
even	though	he	is	the	owner	son	it	requires	knowledge	and	support	from	the	old	people	who	have	experience	before
however	as	new	generation	he	must	be	game	changer	to	change	the	business	in	time	and	survive	in	the	changing	era
this	part	comes	from	reasoning	asking	and	listening	to	issues	from	all	parties
in	order	to	decide	what	is	best	for	customers
the	advent	of	digital	marketing	everyone	agreed	that	all	tools	are	important	in	digital	marketing
khun	platu	is	divided	into	advertisements	that	use	the	money	to	buy	like	google	adwords	google	search	website	banners
and	the	other	part	is	the	personal	recommendation	section	reviews	from	real	customers	on	facebook	ig	trip	advisor
in	which	these	two	parts	must	be	balanced	and	the	bloggers	who	are	now	doing	as	business	as	well
another	important	thing	is	to	update	the	trends	to	stay	ahead	of	the	competition
khun	bum	added	that	digital	marketing	requires	bit	of	time	to	do	it	and	will	know	which	tools	are	suitable	for	our	business
like	the	baiyoke	hotel	which	focuses	on	mass	customers	it	mainly	uses	facebook
but	at	hua	chang	heritage	which	focuses	on	luxury	mainly	uses	ig
including	reviews	on	trip	advisor
therefore	when	there	is	an	issue	it	must	be	cleared	with	the	customer	to	end	it	there
do	not	allow	customers	to	extend	to	social	media	because	it	will	be	difficult	to	solve	for	khun	neung	view	digital	marketing	is	tool	for	connecting	between	hotels	and	customers
releasing	the	advertisement	does	not	hope	that	customers	will	buy	immediately
but	creating	awareness	for	customers	to	know	that	we	are	here
if	there	are	comments	whether	positive	or	negative	must	be	dealt	with	immediately
otherwise	it	might	spread	big	deal
and	each	digital	media	platform	has	different	roles
must	try	it	for	while	and	then	know	which	one	works	for	us
as	for	all	platforms	can	be	used	to	connect	with	customers
in	addition	all	three	commented	that	they	should	not	use	either	platform	alone
for	while	should	go	back	and	try	other	platforms
because	trends	change	very	quickly
today	this	platform	works	does	not	mean	that	it	will	work	forever
today	this	platform	doesn	work	maybe	the	next	day	will	come	back	to	work	again
and	even	digital	media	can	save	you	money	and	reach	lot	of	customers	but	the	offline	media	itself	is	still	not	abandoned
just	reduce	the	amount	and	if	there	is	an	opportunity	to	get	free	pr	offline	it	shouldn	be	left	behind
change	game	fights	the	economy	in	the	condition	that	the	baht	appreciates	at	present	have	broad	impact	on	every	business
khun	platu	commented	that	entrepreneurs	must	learn	more	more	intelligent	and	work	harder
find	ways	to	reach	out	to	more	customers
find	techniques	for	experimenting	with	new	media
doing	new	promotions	that	are	more	distinct
same	as	khun	neung	who	thinks	that	even	though	there	are	still	numbers	of	tourists	but	the	spending	per	capita	decreases
entrepreneurs	must	therefore	diligently	find	ways	to	reach	more	customers
including	having	to	spread	the	risk
the	chain	of	hotels	penetrates	different	customer	groups	according	to	the	price	level
for	example	sbox	small	hotel	in	soi	sukhumvit	cost	baht	night	becoming	hotel	that	makes	lot	of	money
how	necessary	is	the	hotel	chain
in	the	hotel	business	world	hotel	chain	brands	are	one	of	the	selling	points
but	for	these	businessmen	it	is	not	necessary	to	use	the	hotel	chain	brand	always
khun	platu	pointed	out	the	people	issues	that	big	hotel	brands	will	send	to	manage	the	business
who	will	be
will	people	from	big	brands	with	thousands	of	affiliates	love	the	hotels	and	manage	them	as	if	they	were	the	owners
which	they	cannot	fight	with	us	because	we	are	proud	that	the	hotel	is	ours
which	is	matter	of	passion	that	we	have	more	than	big	brands
customer	reviews	are	even	more	outstanding	than	the	big	chain	brands
and	tourists	don	want	the	experience	of	hotel	chain	that	all	are	the	same	but	want	to	have	local	experience
as	for	the	question	if	the	hotel	chain	brand	is	not	used	will	people	be	confident	in	the	standards
khun	bum	views	that	the	hotel	chain	brand	was	previously	advantageous	because	customers	believe	in	quality	service	standards
nowadays	customers	can	see	real	life	reviews	on	social	media
the	advantage	of	hotel	chain	here	is	gone
and	the	management	by	the	owner	is	unique
like	we	really	welcome	our	guests	is	service	from	the	heart	not	just	following	the	guideline	specified
in	terms	of	cost	khun	nueng	shared	information	that	the	use	of	hotel	chain	has	commissioned	from	the	outset
the	wage	of	personnel	coming	in	to	take	care	of	etc
the	current	marketing	tools	allow	entrepreneurs	to	create	their	own	brands
if	the	character	of	the	hotel	is	clear	our	brand	will	stand	out	attracting	customers	who	want	local	experience
is	the	chinese	tourist	market	still	good
chinese	tourists	are	large	group	of	markets	for	thai	hotels
for	the	chain	there	are	two	places	that	accept	chinese	tourists
khun	nueng	views	that	the	chinese	market	has	not	disappeared	anywhere
but	if	we	are	going	to	do	the	chinese	market	we	must	accept	the	character	and	the	culture
there	are	main	groups	of	chinese	customers	which	are	tour	groups	from	chinese	agents
and	the	group	that	comes	to	travel	by	oneself	will	book	through	trip	large	chinese	online	booking	for	the	baiyoke	hotel	have	chinese	customer	base	from	time	immemorial
baiyoke	buffet	people	per	day	about	people	are	chinese	tourists
khun	bum	spoke	about	the	chinese	customer	group	as	group	that	rarely	canceled	the	reservation
regardless	of	what	happens	in	the	country	chinese	customers	are	the	least	lost
if	chinese	customers	can	be	grouped	and	taken	good	care	of	it	will	be	very	worthwhile	market
chinese	customers	staying	in	sri	panwa	are	good	customers
khun	platu	thinks	the	chinese	market	is	still	growing
because	now	the	proportion	of	chinese	who	travel	abroad	is	not	large
in	addition	chinese	people	have	more	status	and	purchasing	power	every	year
if	the	reputation	standards	can	be	maintained	will	get	many	new	chinese	tourists	to	come	and	stay
dream	hotel	concept	because	of	the	digital	entry	concept	khun	nueng	looks	at	the	image	of	the	hotel	in	the	future	that	the	hotel	owner	may	not	have	to	be	the	sole	owner	of	the	whole	building
each	floor	may	be	owned	by	different	person
and	use
technology	for	check	in	check	out	which	is	dream	hotel
for	khun	bum	the	dream	hotel	is	picture	of	wide	area	with	lot	of	trees	peaceful	atmosphere	but	surrounded	by	all	facilities	such	as	bts	like	hua	chang	heritage	on	larger	scale
key	success	in	work	life	the	driving	force	of	khun	bum	is	to	take	care	of	the	staff	of	baiyoke	group	like	family	members	have	good	life	and	have	sense	of	belonging
khun	bum	gives	importance	to	human	management	team	building	giving	employees	sense	of	belonging	together
don	come	just	to	work	day	by	day
in	managing	the	hotel	chain	khun	nueng	mentioned	principles	which	are	each	hotel	character	must	be	clear	control	the	cost	not	to	leak	by	using	technology	to	help
take	care	of	human	resources
must	update	new	business	situations	and	trends	all	the	time
do	not	miss	even	one	thing	because	if	you	miss	the	opportunity	before	that	opportunity	will	come	again
ending	with	the	opinion	of	khun	platu	key	success	is	how	to	make	the	customer	experience	good
normally	the	tourists	who	come	to	visit	they	are	ready	to	have	fun	and	come	to	have	good	experience	already
so	coming	back	to	the	starting	point	is	our	passion	that	will	be	communicated	to	the	staff	to	deliver	good	experience	to	customers
if	an	error	occurs	then	the	staff	are	sincere	in	looking	after	and	improving	customers	experience	will	see	and	feel	this	passion
providing	good	experiences	to	customers	is	therefore	the	heart	of	the	super	luxury	hotel	sri	panwa
enhancing	business	services	to	more	advanced	than	ever	new	digital	banking	platform	for	enhancing	the	good	financial	experience	for	business	customers
when	technology	becomes	hero	that	unravels	the	messes	in	our	life	that	lazy	little	we	just	get	bigger
by	the	time	we	know	it	it	is	impossible	for	us	to	escape	from	the	convenience	of	ordering	via	online	application
in	one	aspect	it	seems	like	risk	in	raising	the	expenses	but	if	we	know	the	right	time	to	use	that	laziness	our	life	could	be	pretty	fabulous
see	the	beauty	in	laziness	in	times	of	fatigue	and	darkness	human	needs	utilities	to	ease	their	pain	point
since	application	fulfills	desires	we	call	this	lazy	economy	because	it	allows	more	convenient	life
for	examples	there	is	no	need	to	go	through	the	hectic	traffic	look	for	parking	or	queue	up	and	we	even	have	time	to	relax	and	listen	to	podcast	at	home

understand	laziness	through	new	normal	the	outbreak	of	pandemic	covid	drives	technology	to	become	an	important	assistant	in	the	new	normal
even	though	some	people	did	not	understand	or	avoided	getting	their	life	involved	with	the	digital	world	when	the	situation	forces	them	to	they	have	no	other	choice	but	to	try
for	example	people	will	have	to	work	from	home	by	using	online	programs	for	meetings	do	an	online	seminar	and	shop	through	online	platforms	that	many	people	have	started	to	be	addicted	to	the	fast	moving	technology	that	creates	similar	vibes	to	classroom	and	meeting	room
victory	from	laziness	we	always	think	that	the	importance	of	technology	is	that	it	does	many	tasks	on	our	behalves	but	most	importantly	it	could	reduce	the	cost	of	our	living
the	examples	would	be	when	we	crave	for	our	favourite	food	that	is	selling	in	the	community	that	parking	is	impossible	these	services	will	help	us	to	save	fuel	cost	and	our	precious	time	or	we	can	benefit	from	coins	system	from	the	online	supermarket	when	there	is	promotion	that	is	cheaper	than	that	of	the	actual	supermarket	and	we	do	not	have	to	push	those	trolleys	around	when	the	products	are	delivered	at	our	doorstep

be	lazy	as	much	as	we	like	as	long	as	we	are	disciplined	we	might	spend	more	money	in	the	name	of	laziness	but	if	we	record	our	spending	in	real	time	and	constantly	remind	ourselves	when	we	encounter	that	our	expenses	are	too	high	we	can	then	decrease	our	laziness	and	slow	down	the	rate	of	the	delivery	order
this	can	be	way	for	us	to	be	financially	disciplined

use	to	develop	on	the	bright	side	the	increased	popularity	of	the	lazy	economy	will	positively	affect	all	related	parties
from	the	buyers	who	get	to	experience	fast	delivery	of	goods	and	services	to	sellers	who	get	to	sell	their	products	in	larger	quantity	and	obtain	more	money	to	search	for	or	develop	new	products
as	for	the	medium	or	platforms	they	will	have	to	improve	their	system	and	service	to	match	the	ever	changing	consumer	behavior

the	small	ones	get	to	shine	the	digital	world	erases	the	restriction	of	those	with	lower	cost	and	changes	anyone	into	popular	sellers	overnight
when	the	light	in	front	of	the	store	flashes	on	the	online	platform	those	with	lower	budget	will	get	to	show	their	true	worth	and	let	their	creativity	shine	on	the	platform	that	various	customers	can	access
an	example	would	be	the	application	robinhood	food	delivery	platform	by	scb	that	does	not	charge	users
it	was	launched	to	fix	the	same	old	problem	that	sometimes	causes	stores	to	earn	less	or	places	more	responsibility	on	buyers	that	they	have	to	pay	more
it	also	helps	to	create	flow	for	the	food	stores	as	the	money	can	be	cleared	within	an	hour

if	the	society	can	survive	we	can	in	the	modern	world	growing	alone	might	not	be	enough	especially	the	social	issues	that	require	the	voices	of	all	related	parties
similarly	scb	launched	robinhood	an	online	application	as	an	option	to	ease	the	burden	of	the	climbing	cost	of	living
all	these	are	because	of	the	belief	that	if	the	society	can	survive	we	as	parts	of	it	will	also	survive
in	life	we	as	human	beings	can	be	lazy
however	if	we	can	utilize	our	laziness	at	the	right	place	and	time	it	would	not	hurt	our	financial	condition	that	we	can	leisurely	surf	amidst	the	lazy	economy	with	breeze

when	cafes	struggle	with	world	class	battle	like	covid	will	use	the	same	methods	probably	won	survive
listen	to	the	strategy	of	defeating	covid	with	the	startup	method	using	data	as	tool	for	class	cafe
the	famous	coffee	shop	from	the	beginning	did	not	choose	to	invade	bangkok	first	but	aimed	to	build	base	and	grow	from	the	northeast
by	using	the	curve	growth	strategy	of	startup	until	the	business	grows	to	leap
with	business	that	never	closes	hours	but	when	big	storm	like	covid	is	even	stronger	than	the	tsunami
as	the	business	is	on	the	brink	of	startup	how	will	the	business	respond	to	covid	and	how	to	lead	the	team	pass	together
khun	golf	marut	chumkhunthod	ceo	and	founder	class	caf	shared	the	experience	with	us
get	to	know	the	class	caf	tech	company	that	sells	coffee
at	the	beginning	of	the	first	class	caf	the	first	branch	is	at	korat	which	is	considered	the	birthplace	of	the	class
instead	of	running	to	open	in	bangkok	instead	choose	to	expand	into	the	northeast	region
after	opened	branches	changed	the	concept	to	startup	curve	growth	and	began	to	do	co	working	space	concept
because	the	coffee	business	alone	may	not	be	interesting	enough
once	he	started	to	understand	more	information	until	finally	after	becoming	pure	tech	company	adaptation	after	covid	when	consumer	behavior	has	changed	class	started	to	close	high	risk	bangkok	branches	focusing	on	opening	branches	in	isan	where	the	brand	is	strong	few	competitors	and	know	the	market	well	because	isaan	is	the	birthplace	of	class
stop	thinking	like	normal	ceo	startup	ready	to	go	ahead	think	of	whole	new	process	on	the	day	that	all	core	products	die
previously	used	to	think	about	how	to	compete	for	customers	or	how	customers	sit	in	the	shop	for	long	time
became	an	idea	of	what	would	make	most	class	products	in	the	customer	fridge
where	is	the	customer	must	be	there
customers	are	online	must	be	online
from	the	beginning	they	made	bottle	of	coffee	to	the	doctor
then	someone	needs	therefore	making	bottle	of	coffee	that	the	customer	has	put	in	the	refrigerator	and	then	poured	to	drink	straight	away
from	the	original	view	of	netflix	as	competitor	it	became	compliment
drink	coffee	while	watching	movies
started	to	sell	flash	sale	like	lazada	which	is	the	idea	of	new	generation	of	staff
it	appears	that	sales	have	increased	into	thousand	bottles	which	calss	can	do	because	of	good	backyard	platform	system
when	brands	help	the	community	during	difficult	times	the	community	embraces	in	the	crisis	there	is	still	cuteness	because	the	brand	is	very	close	to	the	community
when	people	know	that	it	in	trouble	they	help	class
doing	car	project	ran	out	to	sell	in	another	district	that	doesn	have	store
instead	of	waiting	to	receive	and	stay	in	the	same	market	trying	to	find	new	market	that	has	never	been	exposed	before
korat	is	large	province	and	there	are	districts	that	do	not	reach
go	out	to	touch	people	by	having	people	place	orders	in	advance	through	the	app
because	doing	community	empathetic	marketing	or	do	activities	with	doctor	nurse
it	appears	that	the	person	who	orders	from	the	districts	is	doctor	in	the	hospital	district	government
every	time	the	car	went	out	therefore	must	visit	every	hospital	every	district	public	health
there	was	doctor	dressed	in	ground	cloth	and	ran	to	pick	up	the	coffee
one	time	the	doctor	brought	wheelchair	to	pick	up	the	coffee
car	out	for	day	pulled	out	the	stock	in	the	head	office	and	large	branch
this	is	possible	because	of	the	aftermath	of	social	activities
and	the	brand	doing	activities	with	the	hospital	help	sincerely	without	expecting	anything	to	come	back
various	hospitals	are	familiar	with	the	brand	make	today	that	needs	the	most	customers	to	get	strong	support	from	customers
made	him	aware	that	when	there	was	crisis	of	being	in	the	community	and	helping	each	other	is	very	important
leadership	and	changing	employee	attitudes	khun	golf	said	that	the	hardest	thing	because	the	staff	is	new	generation	that	grows	with	the	success	of	the	organization
when	covid	came	in	start	closing	branches	in	bangkok	but	opened	branch	in	khon	kaen	which	at	that	time	was	still	selling	wells
the	team	doesn	understand	why	they	need	to	prepare	for	plan	plan	must	begin	to	communicate	more	clearly	that	what	if	we	couldn	sell	today
once	everyone	understands	being	in	survival	mode
move	branches	move	duties	from	being	coffee	barista	have	to	deliver	the	goods	instead
if	you	served	customer	you	must	come	to	work	to	receive	orders	online
when	understanding	resulting	in	adjustment	and	everyone	still	has	job	helping	to	think	of	changing	channels	change	products	change	everything	immediately	to	the	customer
the	higher	sales	figures	are	reflected	in	the	data	suggesting	that	the	adjustment	has	positive	effect
the	business	of	class	is	to	generate	sales
no	branch	created	branches	may	not	be	large	but	good	profits	and	good	income	are	enough
just	change	the	way	you	think	business	can	go	on
what	new	innovations	have	occurred
class	has	branch	in	the	heart	of	khon	kaen	university	which	is	considered	as	the	nd	house	has	an	application	that	can	place	orders	in	advance	can	pay	through	the	app	straight	away
arrive	do	not	open	the	door	the	door	will	open	by	itself
and	can	receive	the	coffee	ordered
which	fits	in	an	era	where	people	don	want	to	experience	anything	which	was	something	designed	before	therefore	being	well	connected
the	new	model	and	user	experience	are	contactless	which	is	the	new	new	normal	of	new	retail
everyone	will	have	experience	in	the	application	before	choosing	to	finish
this	is	the	future	and	can	be	adapted	for	other	businesses	too
in	addition	the	introduction	of	green	tea	is	famous	for	helping	to	resist	germs	mixed	in	gels	alcohols	and	hand	lotions
including	making	flash	sale	and	car	delivery
there	is	breakthrough	from	selling	expensive	bakeries	or	cookies	that	can	be	sold	right	now
come	to	sell	large	loaves	of	bread	that	customers	can	eat	throughout	the	house	and	selling	sticky	rice	with	fried	pork
must	change	the	way	of	thinking	not	sticking	and	selling	anything	that	customers	are	full	of	throughout	the	house	and	price	do	not	charge	the	brand	fee
as	far	as	being	able	to	sell	then	having	work	when	rethinking	the	kitchen	team	therefore	has	work	to	do

began	to	see	the	ability	of	the	team	in	technology	more
if	you	can	do	many	things	by	yourself	for	example	delivery	by	yourself	is	an	interesting	thing

don	wait	to	be	ready	like	before

can	see	that	class	is	just	one	customer	of	platform
because	once	there	is	clear	platform	the	picture	of	the	jigsaw	puzzle	that	shows	the	image	of	more	startup	the	team	thinking	more	systematically	more	platform
how	do	general	smes	have	lot	of	data	or	how	can	they	use	technology
khun	golf	used	to	recommend	the	owner	of	la	carte	restaurant	that	was	closed

class	also	accepts	orders	via	facebook	and	line
where	are	the	customers
technology	is	only	important	but	is	observing	and	understanding	customer	behavior
advice	for	entrepreneurs	the	hardest	periods	are	close	and	open
if	we	run	out	of	stores	we	will	have	full	cost
while	our	income	may	come	only
especially	in	this	period	where	the	government	does	not	want	to	have	lot	of	people	entering	the	shop	and	the	issue	of	social	distancing	which	cannot	receive	the	same	customers
opening	business	is	therefore	risky	because	the	expenditures	are	full	but	the	income	may	only	behalf
the	shop	is	fully	opened	and	there	is	no	customer
therefore	we	must	see	the	matter	of	opening	gradually	opening
people	who	open	fast	will	be	damaged
some	spots	that	don	need	to	be	opened	should	wait	and	see
because	if	putting	money	into	this	round	and	being	locked	down	again	what	is	the	money	come	from
this	is	very	dangerous	matter
think	carefully
the	concept	that	we	got	from	the	class	is	non	adherence	regardless	of	position	or	even	the	original	core	product	that	has
when	there	is	crisis	both	executives	and	employees	must	see	at	the	same	point
adapted	to	the	mode	of	survival
adjust	according	to	customer	behavior
where	are	the	customers	we	must	be	there
must	go	there	and	use	the	data	available	to	decide	what	to	continue	or	what	to	stop
another	important	thing	is	to	have	strong	customer	base
being	good	member	of	the	community	giving	without	hope	of	rewards	because	in	the	end	during	difficult	times	communities	will	embrace	and	support	to	survive	together

many	entrepreneurs	emerging	in	healthy	restaurant	business
the	following	tips	includes	how	to	know	your	way	around	the	industry	and	start	your	very	own	business
getting	into	the	market	delicious	food	alone	does	not	make	business	but	it	requires	good	marketing	strategy
at	the	beginning	entrepreneurs	must	build	customer	trust	with	the	use	of	high	quality	ingredients	and	cooking	process
take	into	consideration	how	to	design	menu	variety	food	portion	and	the	way	to	maintain	food	taste	and	quality

the	target	markets	of	healthy	foods	would	definitely	wish	to	consume	hygienic	safe	low	fat	foods	with	cooking	methods	that	preserve	nutrition
in	the	beginning	you	might	want	to	target	small	community	near	you	first	for	healthy	or	clean	food	business
it	would	give	you	lot	of	advantage	if	your	restaurant	situated	in	prime	office	area
the	customer	segment	expansion	can	leverage	your	business	into	segment	of	corporate	or	small	event	organizer	lunch	box	or	snack	bock	services
if	your	business	offers	both	delicious	foods	and	excellence	service	word	of	mouth	will	spread	and	increase	your	popularity
it	also	helps	maintain	growth	momentum	of	your	business
this	method	is	the	simplest	at	lowest	cost	but	might	takes	bit	of	time
pricing	when	setting	price	of	clean	food	it	should	match	the	quality	of	your	ingredient
use	market	price	as	reference	for	instance	main	course	dish	would	price	between	thb	price	range
hence	priced	healthy	food	higher	starting	from	thb
by	choosing	an	appealing	food	package	can	increase	your	unit	price
calculate	raw	material	cost	for	each	box	including	delivery	cost	and	labor	cost
you	might	want	to	try	delivery	application	to	offer	customer	convenience	and	facilitate	your	sales	order	process
do	not	forget	to	include	relevant	costs	into	your	price	calculation
enhance	restaurant	atmosphere	decorate	your	restaurant	with	pictures	related	to	the	journey	of	your	business
the	decoration	will	give	your	customer	good	read	while	waiting	for	their	foods
build	customer	confidence	with	displays	of	high	quality	food	ingredients	including	food	preparation	process
it	gives	the	impression	of	how	much	you	put	heart	and	care	for	the	restaurant
painting	inside	the	restaurant	with	warm	tone
prohibit	pets	from	entering	the	premise	for	sanitary	and	hygiene	condition	of	the	restaurant
you	need	to	make	sure	everything	is	clean	and	healthful
selling	food	online	or	through	social	media	is	good	alternative	for	people	with	limited	investment	funds	facebook	instagram	line	and	etc
keep	your	customer	coming	back	to	you	by	maintaining	standard	of	food	ingredients	and	deliciousness
today	the	retail	business	is	well	known	and	widespread	among	investors	in	thailand
despite	the	relatively	high	competition	many	companies	see	the	opportunity	to	expand	their	business	to	neighboring	countries
especially	the	country	cambodia	that	is	being	watched	among	the	retail	business
because	that	is	another	country	in	clmv	that	is	worth	investing	in	or	expanding	business
due	to	the	economic	growth	even	during	the	covid	outbreak	gdp	in	is	projected	to	grow	at	and	there	is	chance	to	grow	in	with	this	overall	economic	growth	forecast	as	result	thailand	largest	retailer	cp	all	or	as	we	know	it	as	the	company	that	manages	eleven	convenience	stores	has	made	strategic	decision	to	expand	its	business	to	cambodia
of	course	this	expansion	of	cp	all	business	will	make	the	competition	in	cambodia	retail	market	more	intense
and	more	interesting	to	follow	it	also	affects	the	overall	economic	activity	in	the	country	as	well
the	eleven	business	in	cambodia	is	managed	by	subsidiary	of	cp	all	or	cp	all	cambodia	co	ltd	in	the	beginning	the	company	was	managed	by	an	experienced	management	team	from	thailand
and	many	local	staff	are	being	hired	for	operational	staff	the	company	opened	its	first	eleven	store	in	phnom	penh	in	august	which	was	well	received	by	cambodian	customers
eleven	entry	into	the	convenience	store	market	is	considered	next	normal	and	is	an	important	development	step	in	the	cambodia	retail	market
this	made	the	convenience	store	business	significantly	more	active
customers	or	consumers	get	new	experiences	from	leading	convenience	stores	from	thailand
during	the	initial	investment	period	eleven	to	establish	eleven	stores	will	start	from	important	business	cities	such	as	phnom	penh	siem	reap	province
battambang	province	and	preah	sihanouk	province	etc	which	is	province	where	many	famous	convenience	stores	have	entered	the	business
currently	eleven	main	branches	in	cambodia	are	eleven	chroy	changvar	first	branch	eleven	ptt	preak	pnov	station	eleven	ptt	prey	kei	station	eleven	ptt	chbar	ampov	station	eleven	ptt	phsar
touch	station	eleven	rule	monivong	and	eleven	season	mall	poipet
more	than	of	the	products	sold	in	eleven	are	from	thailand
it	is	product	that	we	are	familiar	with
products	that	can	be	seen	everywhere	at	eleven	in	thailand
this	is	another	channel	for	entrepreneurs	to	see	an	opportunity	to	expand	their	business	through	modern	trade	that	is	using	eleven	or	even	other	well	known	department	stores	to	export	products	for	sale
this	will	help	enhance	the	good	image	of	the	brand
make	it	brand	that	is	well	known	and	accepted	by	consumers	more	widely
nowadays	there	are	convenience	stores	that	are	popular	in	cambodia
there	are	many	there	are	convenience	stores	run	by	local	operators	such	as	kiwi	mart	lucky	express	supermarket	chip	mong	express	nham	and	smile	mini	mart	among	others
foreign	stores	that	have	invested	in	such	as	aeon	maxvalu	super	duper	and	circle	and	convenience	stores	from	thailand	such	as	eleven	and	mini	big	etc
the	expansion	of	eleven	stores	and	retail	stores	in	the	future	in	addition	to	helping	to	increase	the	commercial	value	of	the	product	even	more	can	also	penetrate	the	market	to	variety	of	target	groups	such	as	tourists	who	come	to	cambodia	at	least	million	per	year	before	the	epidemic	and	business	people
including	foreign	workers	living	in	large	cities	more	than	hundred	thousand	people
it	is	also	good	opportunity	for	many	thai	entrepreneurs	who	can	expand	their	distribution	channels	to	sell	their	products	in	the	cambodian	market
through	negotiations	with	eleven	under	new	conditions	that	are	different	from	thailand
the	reason	why	the	eleven	brand	in	thailand	is	known	to	many	cambodian	consumers	because	the	middle	to	upper	class	groups	regularly	travel	to	thailand
and	hundreds	of	thousands	of	cambodian	workers	working	in	thailand
including	thai	advertising	media	dramas	movies	music	from	many	channels	that	reach	cambodian	people	giving	thai	retailers	competitive	advantage
and	it	is	an	additional	channel	for	thai	entrepreneurs	who	want	to	expand	their	products	to	the	cambodian	market	to	have	more	opportunities	as	well
although	modern	trade	stores	are	constantly	increasing	from	europe	america	japan	china	and	thailand	including	cambodian	investors
but	of	cambodia	main	channels	for	purchasing	goods	are	still	traditional	markets	such	as	stalls	and	wholesale	markets
this	makes	modern	trade	only	of	the	total	population
most	of	them	are	in	the	capital	and	tourist	cities
most	of	modern	trade	clients	are	foreigners	living	in	cambodia
tourist	and	those	with	middle	income	and	above	only
the	main	target	group	is	young	people	with	high	purchasing	power
and	can	be	open	to	change	as	well	the	city	that	stands	out	for	investment	and	market	expansion	is	inevitable	phnom	penh
with	population	of	million	the	demand	for	goods	and	services	has	grown	quite	rapidly
because	there	are	consumer	groups	with	high	purchasing	power
family	charter	is	familys	code	of	conduct	and	agreement	on	family	members	roles	in	the	family	business	and	society
it	also	sets	guidelines	on	family	business	governance	the	familys	core	values	vision	and	business	commitment
such	agreements	are	written	for	clear	effect	among	family	members
clear	family	charter	and	clear	business	management	system	are	tools	promoting	transparency	among	family	members
every	member	can	learn	their	duties	and	rights	in	their	home	and	family	business	roles	which	will	differ	according	to	circumstances
family	business	management	is	different	from	other	types	of	business
family	relationships	may	lead	to	emotions	and	feelings	interfering	in	decision	making
to	prevent	potential	conflicts	family	charter	should	be	formulated
each	family	can	have	different	family	charter	to	allow	the	nomination	of	the	most	appropriate	family	member	as	business	successor	without	causing	disputes	among	other	members	running	the	family	business
although	family	charters	may	vary	overall	they	consist	of	governance	committee	with	an	executive	board	overseeing	the	business	and	family	council	overseeing	family	matters
family	governance	committee	consists	of	two	parts	family	council	and	an	executive	board
members	of	family	council	are	seniors	who	can	be	stakeholders	in	the	family	business	or	not	but	are	respected	by	other	family	members
members	of	an	executive	board	may	include	third	parties	such	as	chief	executive	officer	or	executives	accepted	by	family	members
the	numb
family	fund	management	the	family	council	should	be	set	up	to	manage	family	funds	and	reach	an	agreement	on	arrangements	of	necessary	welfare	for	family	members	such	as	education	medical	expenses	and	housing
for	example	resolution	on	whether	childs	education	is	eligible	for	family	funds	or	requires	the	parents	own	money	should	be	agreed	upon	by	the	family	council
ers	of	members	and	votes	and	voting	rights	vary	by	family	business	some	family	business	resolutions	are	based	on	individual	votes	while	others	are	based	on	shareholding	percentages
however	there	are	similar	key	principles	held	by	each	family	business	as	follows	in	short	good	family	business	governance	depends	on	the	ability	to	manage	the	different	needs	of	major	and	minor	shareholders	and	different	systems	between	family	and	business	managing	the	different	needs	of	family	members	with	professionalism	transparency	and	accountability	for	long	term	success	and	sustainable	growth	while	fostering	family	solidarity	and	happiness	as	well

the	future	of	economics	is	now
the	economic	system	is	an	important	factor	to	nurture	from	small	point	like	individuals	like	us	expose	to	families	countries	regions	and	the	world
how	did	covid	change	the	economic	system
has	anyone	got	or	has	lost
and	what	other	factors	affect	the	economy	at	both	the	individual	and	organizational	levels
is	there	anything	that	we	as	person	and	part	of	the	mechanism	to	drive	the	economy	requires	adjustment	both	the	mind	and	behavior
including	what	we	must	learn	to	live	and	win	in	the	new	normal	economy
listen	to	opinions	and	views	from	dr	chai	or	dr	sittipon	wibunthanakun
who	is	an	expert	in	economics	and	the	author	of	the	book	opportunities	for	the	future	and	is	talented	person	making	economics	easy	to	understand	and	fun
fundamental	thai	economy	before	covid	during	the	years	before	the	covid	crisis	the	thai	economy	has	relatively	low	growth	compared	to	other	countries	in	the	same	region
in	which	thailand	grew	only	while	neighboring	countries	such	as	vietnam	grew	malaysia	grew
called	that	even	without	the	covid	the	thai	economy	has	grown	low	for	while
but	looking	back	about	years	before	the	crisis	of	tom	yam	kung	in	the	thai	economy	has	grown	to
foreign	countries	are	even	called	the	miracle	of	asia
another	years	before	the	hamburger	crisis	in	the	united	states	thailand	grew	by
will	see	that	the	growth	rate	is	reduced	by	half
and	after	the	hamburger	crisis	in	until	now	growth	has	decreased	by	half	to	just
will	see	that	the	thai	economy	is	declining	steadily	until	now	being	called	asian	patients	when	covid	entered	the	situation	collapsed	again
the	problem	can	be	seen	in	both	the	household	and	business	sectors
household	deflation	income	the	agricultural	sector	which	constitutes	of	the	country	total	labor	has	steady	decline	in	income
crop	price	fluctuations	including	the	uncertain	income	problem	that	is	getting	worse
which	partly	comes	from	climate	fluctuations
concerns	about	household	debt	increase	are	worrisome	because	it	increases	from	to	gdp	to	per	gpd
and	found	that	thai	people	in	debt	are	younger
half	of	the	year	olds	already	have	debt	and	in	of	the	debt	and	is	npl
causing	the	overall	quality	of	life	of	thai	people	to	be	poor
because	earning	less	money	and	having	to	use	the	money	to	pay	off	debt
and	found	that	most	retirees	still	have	debt
is	it	burden	for	the	children	to	pay	debt	which	makes	the	overall	picture	of	the	thai	household	sector	not	very	strong
economic	sector	low	investment	labor	does	not	increase	wages
resulting	in	lower	consumption	capability
finally	the	dependency	of	the	thai	economy	is	the	government	that	requires	money	to	stimulate	the	economy
and	another	part	that	helped	boost	the	economy	in	the	past	before	covid	were	exports	and	tourism	that	helped	support	the	economy
but	when	there	is	trade	war	between	china	and	the	united	states	causing	the	global	economy	to	slow
therefore	affecting	thai	exports
resulting	in	only	the	government	remaining	able	to	stimulate	the	economy
while	having	to	spend	money	to	inject	into	the	system	but	because	of	the	lower	income	the	increase	in	taxes	is	therefore	difficult
therefore	waiting	for	government	assistance	is	not	sustainable	solution
thai	economy	and	the	impact	of	covid	covid	greatly	affects	the	thai	economy
because	we	rely	heavily	on	exports	and	tourism
once	the	lockdown	occurs	we	can	export	less	lost	tourism
which	we	rely	on	tourism	income	to	of	gdp
when	locking	down	from	covid	the	business	was	stopped
broken	purchasing	power	which	still	does	not	count	businesses	in	the	shadow	economy
such	as	night	business	pubs	bars	gambling	businesses	that	had	to	close
which	causes	lot	of	lost	revenue	in	the	system
in	addition	to	having	negative	impact	on	the	economy	still	affecting	lifestyle
having	to	stay	at	home	causes	less	shopping
plus	the	cost	of	living	more	such	as	masks	hand	washing	gels
the	department	store	business	also	has	lower	incomes	but	costs	have	increased	from	measures	such	as	social	distancing
including	the	business	is	uncertainty	no	one	dares	to	invest
don	know	when	the	situation	will	end	and	don	know	what	the	future	will	be
which	affects	almost	all	business	sectors
in	asian	countries	we	have	the	most	contraction	because	of	our	dependence	on	exports	and	tourism
it	is	predicted	that	the	economy	will	be	negative	from	of	gdp
businesses	that	benefit	from	covid	overall	business	that	can	change	the	lives	of	consumers	from	offline	to	online
because	people	are	locked	down	like	business	models	or	marketing	methods	must	change
because	people	decide	to	buy	now	has	changed	from	the	original	for	example	their	children	manage	online	shopping	in	the	house	instead	of	parents	who	are	not	familiar	with	technology	etc
the	new	shark	that	is	bigger	than	covid	the	challenges	that	await	us	the	international	economy	is	declining
ajarn	chai	said	that	in	the	past	the	global	economy	was	better	than	this
world	trade	has	good	turnover
but	now	there	is	more	protection	in	the	trade	such	as	the	brexit	case
in	the	past	we	have	always	been	leaders	of	world	economies	such	as	the	united	states	europe	the	wto	or	the	imf	that	promote	free	trade	economy
when	the	hamburger	crisis	came	to	an	end	in	the	american	economy	went	into	recession
by	the	year	europe	has	public	debt	problem
causing	the	once	declining	country	to	become	unable	to	be	the	main	consumer	of	the	world
because	before	america	and	europe	were	the	main	consumers	of	thailand
but	now	these	countries	import	less
thailand	relies	on	new	economic	countries	such	as	china	india	russia	and	rising	brazil
and	there	are	many	consumers
therefore	have	these	countries	to	help	support	the	global	economy
but	now	the	economies	of	many	countries	are	worsening	including	china	russia	and	brazil
only	india	is	still	strong
but	only	india	alone	cannot	help	everyone
there	is	currently	no	country	that	will	lead	the	world	economy	as	before
the	belief	in	free	trade	has	changed
every	country	protects	itself	more
domestic	economy	in	fact	the	economic	perspective	is	more	interested	in	the	quality	of	life	than	gdp
which	is	to	make	thai	people	have	better	life
which	means	having	more	gdp	per	capita	to	have	the	ability	to	consume	more
looking	back	at	years	the	per	capita	income	of	thai	people	is	times	more	than	china	but	from	onwards	now	the	per	capita	income	of	chinese	people	has	overtaken	us
our	income	per	capita	increases	but	slowly	increases
while	other	countries	increased	at	faster	rate
therefore	slowing	access	to	the	quality	of	life	of	thai	people
what	are	the	factors	that	make	you	eat	well	and	increase	your	income	every	year
the	answer	is	that	the	ability	to	produce	products	and	services	must	improve
which	the	productivity	of	thailand	compared	to	other	countries	we	increased	more	slowly	than	others	causing	our	income	to	increase	more	slowly	as	well
such	as	rice	cultivation	currently	we	are	the	lowest	rice	yield	in	asean
one	reason	may	be	that	because	thai	rice	is	of	high	quality	low	production	but	has	good	price
said	that	our	rice	is	more	delicious
but	if	compared	with	similar	terrain	similar	rice	varieties	similar	quality	which	if	compared	with	laos	rice	yield	per	rai	of	laos	is	higher	than	thailand
this	means	that	both	the	quantity	and	quality	we	have	lot	of	problems
is	an	example	of	reduced	competitiveness
and	occurs	in	many	products	is	not	just	rice
many	products	that	we	used	to	sell	before	but	today	do	not	sell
like	in	the	past	we	used	to	sell	parts	for	desktop	computers
but	when	smartphones	grow	we	do	not	have	products	that	meet	their	needs
we	produce	fewer	products	that	the	world	needs
environment	natural	resources	good	quality	soil	deteriorates	every	year	of	good	quality	soil	is	gone
the	question	is	why	it	disappeared
the	answer	is	for	example	we	are	contaminated	in	the	soil	deforestation
when	forests	reduce	soil	quality	they	deteriorate	heat	climate	change	the	world	temperature	keeps	rising
the	rising	of	the	sea	which	affects	many	things	such	as	lost	agricultural	land	soil	quality	becomes	saline
the	quality	of	the	soil	deteriorates	every	year
if	we	do	nothing	we	will	leave	the	soil	well	only	use	for	years
thailand	is	very	dependent	on	soil
make	the	ability	to	grow	worse
the	ability	to	produce	products	is	reduced
global	warming	climate	change	more	frequent	natural	disasters
adb	education	asian	development	bank	estimates	that	every	degree	celsius	at	higher	temperatures	rice	yield	per	rai	will	decrease	by
therefore	thailand	which	is	an	agricultural	country	will	be	very	affected	by	both	global	warming	and	soil	deterioration	problems
which	is	problem	that	has	accumulated	continuously	but	there	is	no	host	to	seriously	solve	the	problem	in	the	next	years	the	world	population	will	increase
we	need	more	food
but	the	global	warming	problem	and	soil	quality	deterioration	resulting	in	decreased	agricultural	productivity
resources	are	getting	more	and	more	limited
or	tiny	dust	problems
pm	also	reflects	that	our	focus	on	industrial	production	regardless	of	the	environment	finally	we	were	charged	the	price
there	is	study	in	the	next	years	if	we	do	nothing	with	the	dust
the	cost	of	treatment	will	increase	by	times
children	with	respiratory	diseases	will	increase	by	times	and	the	productivity	will	decrease
tiny	dust	is	occurring	all	over	the	world
but	people	affected	are	not	equal
according	to	the	research	of	the	population	in	developing	countries	face	the	danger	of	toxic	dust	children	under	the	age	of	in	low	income	countries	are	times	more	likely	to	die	than	wealthy	countries
we	live	in	an	era	of	technology	disruption	such	as	google	map	uber	airbnb	as	an	example	that	changed	the	world
many	things	are	happening	lot	when	compared	to	the	olden	days	such	as	the	production	of	light	bulbs	or	the	industrial	revolution
but	in	the	era	many	technologies	occurred	simultaneously	many	professions	in	the	future	may	not	exist	anymore
children	who	are	studying	at	university	today	before	retiring	may	have	to	change	more	than	jobs
because	the	career	will	always	be	ruined	technology	will	compete	for	career
children	who	are	born	today	do	not	yet	know	what	future	career	they	will	do
because	the	profession	has	not	yet	appeared	these	things	will	be	both	opportunities	and	risks
it	both	benefit	and	penalty
risks	that	entrepreneurs	need	to	keep	in	mind	shark	catch	book	opportunities	and	challenges	are	everywhere

traditional	marketing	tactics	such	as	tv	radio	telephonic	booth	and	email	advertising	are	no	longer	as	effective	as	they	once	were
mr	sitthinan	polvisutsak	co	founder	content	shifu	reveals	all	the	science	of	inbound	marketing	an	important	marketing	strategy	that	businesses	must	do	today
inbound	marketing	delivers	value	to	the	right	customers	the	right	place	and	the	right	time
originally	businesses	would	send	sales	messages	promotions	to	offer	to	customers
inbound	marketing	is	to	deliver	value	to	customers	through	content	send	more	and	more	until	gaining	trust	from	customers	make	the	business	go	well
therefore	the	principle	of	inbound	marketing	is	to	create	valuable	content
delivering	to	the	right	people	at	the	right	time	brings	sustainable	business	results
khun	sitthinan	emphasized	that	getting	business	results	back	is	important
not	just	doing	content	but	not	getting	anything	back
khun	sitthinan	mentioned	reasons	that	make	the	inbound	marketing	strategy	effective	because	people	don	like	being	sold
but	people	like	to	buy	without	being	pushed	lot	advertising	is	everywhere
but	less	efficiency	and	higher	price	inbound	marketing	will	build	long	term	business	by	sharing	business	knowledge	with	customers	will	make	us	become	experts	who	are	trusted	by	customers	inbound	marketing	flywheel	concept	at	present	marketing	has	shifted	from	the	funnel	concept	screening	the	target	audience	to	become	customers	to	the	flywheel	concept	where	the	customer	is	the	center	of	the	wheel	that	consists	of	marketing	sales	and	service	and	has	process	to	meet	their	needs
of	customers	as	follows	attract	and	engage	getting	customers	to	find	our	business	attract	customers	to	come	to	us	online	collect	customer	information	foster	strangers	stranger	who	have	just	come	to	know	our	business
turn	him	into	potential	customer	ready	to	buy	prospect	then	create	interactions	engage	to	become	customers	customers
engage	and	delight	interaction	it	not	sales	pitch	that	annoys	customers
but	talking	to	customers	when	they	are	free	and	managing	to	talk	to	customers	in	large	quantities
delight	and	attract	delight	make	customers	become	promoters	persuade	new	strangers	to	become	new	customers
this	keep	spinning	the	faster	the	wheel	spins
the	customer	base	grows	accordingly	and	most	importantly	inbound	marketing	focuses	on	helping	customers	solve	problems	by	themselves	through	various	knowledge	bases
as	well	as	having	large	number	of	customer	care	management	systems	including	measuring	customer	satisfaction	pros	and	cons	of	inbound	vs	outbound	marketing	in	khun	sitthinan	opinion	inbound	and	outbound	marketing	have	different	advantages	and	disadvantages
inbound	marketing	is	the	content	creation	to	deliver	value	to	customers
doing	it	in	the	beginning	requires	investing	without	seeing	immediate	results
but	over	time	more	and	more	results	will	be	obtained
while	the	cost	remains	the	same
in	contrast	outbound	marketing	is	the	purchase	of	various	forms	of	advertising
the	result	will	be	according	to	the	amount	of	advertising	paid
the	advantage	of	inbound	is	lasting	results
while	the	disadvantage	is	that	the	results	are	not	always	financially	variable	the	results	are	slow	months	year	depending	on	the	industry
you	can	guess	according	to	the	budget	that	goes	down
the	disadvantage	is	that	the	results	are	not	sustainable
if	you	don	pay	the	results	will	be	lost
however	businesses	may	choose	to	use	inbound	and	outbound	marketing	according	to	the	situation	such	as	new	business	openings
with	not	long	hemp	if	you	want	fast	results	start	with	outbound	first	and	when	you	start	getting	leads	from	people	who	are	very	interested	you	start	doing	inbound	that	will	help	your	business	grow	sustainably
what	is	the	difference	between	inbound	marketing	and	content	marketing
the	similarity	of	these	strategies	is	to	create	valuable	content	for	customers
the	difference	is	that	inbound	marketing	focuses	on	winning	business	with	content	while	content	marketing	focuses	on	grabbing	people	attention	with	content
khun	sitthinan	sees	that	content	marketing	is	part	of	inbound	marketing
another	difference	is	that	inbound	marketing	will	bring	lot	of	technology	to	help
content	marketing	will	depend	on	knowledge	and	creativity
things	to	know	before	starting	inbound	marketing	know	our	own	business	understand	that	our	business	how	do	you	exist	in	the	online	world
the	data	can	be	searched	through	various	online	tools	such	as	seoptimer	search	console	google	analytics	social	analytics
understand	customers	who	our	customers	are	their	backgrounds	likes	and	dislikes
who	are	the	stakeholders
what	the	problem	or	need
then	make	it	out	as	persona	through	interviews	with	customers
interview	sales	use	google	analytics	to	get	the	team	on	the	same	page
and	be	able	to	accurately	convey	messages	to	each	customer	in	an	appropriate	manner	study	competitors	who	are	the	competitors
do	something	good	or	bad	can	be	viewed	through	online	tools	such	as	similarweb	etc
summary	of	principles	of	inbound	marketing	website	in	doing	inbound	marketing	the	website	is	the	most	important
because	the	website	is	our	real	property
can	be	customized	to	suit	your	business	and	used	as	storage	for	the	content	that	we	created	by	providing	search	engine	social	media	links	to	find	the	difference	between	website	content	and	social	media	is	content	ownership	that	we	own	the	content	on	the	website
but	if	we	do	social	media	we	do	not	own	the	information	on	the	platform
more	importantly	having	website	makes	your	business	look	credible
and	it	is	found	on	search	engines
this	is	because	social	media	is	not	used	to	search
but	is	used	to	create	interactions
as	result	your	content	will	deteriorate	over	time
content	there	are	many	types	of	content
which	to	choose	what	kind	of	content	to	do	use	the	principles	of	fcb	grid	and	content	matrix	theories
choose	to	create	content	formats	that	meet	your	business	needs	and	communication	goals	such	as	businesses	which	are	mostly	classified	as	high	involvement	thinking	as	products	and	services	that	are	difficult	to	understand
made	to	solve	problems	information	is	essential	for	decision	making
therefore	we	choose	to	do	educational	content	educate	such	as	book	report	infographic	article	video	resource	review	etc
content	promotion	can	be	done	through	search	on	page	off	page	seo	social	media
by	choosing	platform	that	is	suitable	for	the	business	model	offline	channels	such	as	seminars	events	book	releases	etc	and	the	search	ad	which	offers	solutions	to	people	who	are	having	problems	who	come	to	search	google	to	find	solution
it	is	an	advertisement	that	does	not	interfere	with	users
in	this	regard	when	doing	inbound	marketing	attracting	people	to	collect	lead	information	of	interested	people	by	stimulating	interest	in	people	to	do	something	such	as	subscribe	click	via	landing	page	and	use	various	lead	generation	tools	then	have	to	convert	to	create	business	results	which	lead
customers	who	have	become	customers	with	purchasing	power
but	may	not	be	ready	to	make	purchase	right	now	therefore	it	is	necessary	to	nurture	those	customer	leads	with	marketing	automation	tools	and	processes	until	the	customer	finally	decides	to	buy	products	and	services	from	us

by	eakasart	sappachang	hi	light	in	the	last	five	years	have	traveled	to	china	many	times	which	has	allowed	me	to	witness	lot	of	changes	there	that	will	surely	start	to	spill	over	to	thailand	soon
just	last	month	attended	the	china	beauty	expo	in	shanghai	and	want	to	share	what	have	learned	with	all	my	readers	china	is	becoming	more	and	more	beautiful	with	no	end	in	sight
the	china	beauty	expo	is	an	exhibition	of	innovative	new	products	and	technology
saw	many	new	kinds	of	cosmetics	beauty	tools	services	and	trends	introduced	there
the	exhibition	attracts	more	and	more	attendees	every	year	and	this	year	there	were	over	attendees	from	countries	visiting	more	than	booths	hosted	by	entrepreneurs	from	different	countries
as	you	know	china	will	produce	anything	you	can	imagine	as	long	as	you	ve	got	the	budget
there	have	been	many	changes	in	the	last	ten	years
chinese	brands	are	starting	to	emerge	from	the	domestic	market	to	become	major	global	players
free	trade	policies	have	enabled	china	to	benefit	from	the	exchange	of	know	how	from	other	countries	and	this	is	filtering	down	to	chinese	consumers	in	big	way
most	chinese	businesses	are	currently	experiencing	rapid	growth	and	this	includes	the	cosmetics	industry
to	date	there	are	already	more	than	cosmetic	and	beauty	trade	organizations	established	in	china	including	hong	kong	and	taiwan
in	the	asian	brand	building	lab	was	established	which	became	the	kick	off	point	for	the	chinese	beauty	industry
soon	exports	of	chinese	branded	cosmetics	will	follow	the	same	growth	trends	that	technology	and	other	consumer	goods	have
economic	analysis	shows	that	the	cosmetics	market	in	asia	is	the	second	biggest	consumer	goods	market	in	the	world
in	china	the	skin	care	and	cosmetic	industry	has	grown	in	the	last	decade	with	the	growth	of	more	than	in	the	premium	segments
this	is	very	high	rate	so	we	should	try	to	understand	what	has	caused	it
the	main	reason	is	that	china	has	very	young	population
by	the	end	of	this	decade	all	chinese	millennials	will	have	reached	the	working	age	and	be	more	concerned	about	their	appearance
this	generation	has	million	members	with	money	burning	holes	in	the	same	pockets	where	they	keep	their	smartphones
this	all	means	the	beauty	market	in	china	is	going	to	be	changing	rapidly	from	now	on
why	is	the	smartphone	is	so	important
don	forget	that	people	were	trading	on	alibaba	taobao	and	wechat	in	china	long	before	thailand	got	into	commerce
chinese	smartphones	are	also	lot	less	expensive	than	the	american	or	korean	brands	which	means	that	everyone	can	get	online
the	result	of	this	is	that	commerce	has	become	extremely	popular	all	over	china
to	capitalize	on	this	many	premium	brands	from	france	america	and	japan	now	have	their	own	websites	selling	directly	at	the	chinese	consumer
euromonitor	said	that	this	premium	segment	should	experience	continuous	growth	rate	of	in	china	beginning	this	year
this	is	partly	because	brands	from	france	american	and	japan	are	still	considered	an	important	indicator	of	success	in	china
another	unexpected	thing	found	out	about	the	chinese	beauty	market	is	that	now	much	of	it	consists	of	products	for	men
research	from	euromonitor	in	showed	that	of	male	respondents	used	cleansing	milk	lotion	or	face	cream
the	main	reason	for	this	is	because	past	social	values	in	china	favored	son	over	daughter	and	so	the	male	population	is	much	greater	than	the	female	population
most	men	are	comfortable	buying	skin	care	products	and	caring	for	their	appearance	like	women	do	especially	in	the	big	cities	such	as	beijing	shanghai	hangzhou	and	guangzhou
with	the	end	of	china	one	child	policy	the	gender	imbalance	may	stabilize	little	but	today	children	will	be	adults	in	and	then	men	in	their	will	make	up	of	the	population
euromonitor	said	that	this	situation	will	result	in	more	growth	in	men	beauty	and	cosmetics	that	we	have	ever	seen	before
not	only	are	male	beauty	products	popular	in	shops	but	also	in	direct	sales
at	the	beauty	expo	also	learned	that	the	multi	level	marketing	model	is	very	popular	in	china	due	to	the	country	large	size	which	makes	it	sometimes	more	convenient	to	approach	customers	through	vast	selling	network	of	individuals
but	retail	shopping	and	commerce	are	also	growing
most	chinese	shop	owners	are	still	able	to	compete	with	online	shopping	because	people	care	about	the	storefront	shopping	experience	with	its	eye	catching	designs	and	opportunities	to	handle	the	merchandise	before	buying
so	as	you	can	see	china	has	very	large	population	interested	in	both	the	technology	and	the	hardware	aspects	of	shopping
another	thing	that	is	clear	is	that	the	chinese	have	great	ability	to	create	brands	which	would	say	is	following	in	the	footsteps	of	japan	and	south	korea
there	are	now	many	well	known	chinese	brands	ranging	from	dirt	cheap	to	ultra	expensive
they	are	mostly	made	for	domestic	consumption	but	in	another	ten	years	they	will	be	among	china	biggest	exports
small	and	medium	sized	enterprises	who	attach	their	own	brand	labels	to	chinese	products	may	have	to	find	other	sources	as	the	original	manufacturers	will	be	able	to	negotiate	their	own	distribution
however	due	to	runaway	growth	many	chinese	factories	have	been	slow	to	improve	manufacturing	processes	which	have	created	problems	for	the	environment	and	the	quality	of	life	among	laborers
so	we	will	be	seeing	more	beauty	and	cosmetic	products	aimed	at	men	and	people	of	different	socio	economic	status
the	new	products	will	come	in	smaller	package	sizes	that	are	more	convenient	and	safer	for	all	consumers
also	chinese	people	tend	to	favor	more	healthy	natural	and	organic	products
thai	business	owners	who	are	doing	business	with	chinese	companies	may	need	to	find	alternative	sources	or	change	their	business	model	to	be	more	competitive
it	might	be	better	to	create	and	manufacture	your	own	brand	or	invent	something	new	which	could	be	more	sustainable	business	model	for	the	coming	decade
here	wishing	your	business	all	the	best

robot	technology	and	artificial	intelligence	are	increasingly	playing	role	in	many	industries	including	the	medical	community	to	raise	the	efficiency	of	treatment	and	facilitate	the	care	of	patients
especially	during	the	critical	period	covid	is	even	catalyst	for	the	deployment	of	various	innovations	more	than	ever
associate	professor	sitthiporn	srinuannud	md	head	of	eurovision	surgery	siriraj	hospital	talked	about	advances	in	medicine
how	did	covid	change	experience	with	the	doctor
the	outbreak	of	the	covid	virus	causing	the	doctor	to	change	the	treatment	of	patients	at	the	hospital
the	treatment	process	starts	with	patient	history	checking	physical	examination	analysis	of	the	lab	and	treatment
in	which	the	state	of	covid	requires	distance	of	meters	physical	distancing	resulting	in	the	need	to	avoid	physical	examination	that	is	in	close	contact	focus	on	examination	results	in	the	laboratory	instead	such	as	blood	test	secretions	ultrasound	etc
including	dispensing	is	long	distance	medication	dispense	have	relatives	of	patients	to	receive	medicine	instead	or	deliver	medicine	by	post	to	reduce	time	in	the	hospital
in	addition	using	telemedicine	online	is	an	alternative	way	for	patients	to	receive	an	initial	consultation
inquire	about	health	history	before	coming	to	see	doctor
looking	at	the	situation	covid	in	the	future	regarding	the	spread	of	the	covid	virus	dr	sittiporn	commented	that	the	disease	should	spread	for	another	years
in	the	past	the	spanish	flu	epidemic	occurred	many	waves	before	running	out	it	took	years
therefore	having	to	live	with	covid	until	the	vaccine	is	invented	or	effective	treatment	is	achieved
therefore	having	to	live	with	covid	until	the	vaccine	is	invented	or	effective	treatment	is	achieved	everyone	must	adapt	especially	physical	distancing	including	wearing	surgical	mask	washing	hands	registering	for	tracking
to	provide	information	on	whether	you	are	in	risky	area
in	the	last	months	the	visit	to	the	hospital	aimed	at	screening	for	the	covid	patient
affecting	patients	of	other	diseases	more	because	people	don	want	to	come	to	the	hospital	etc
for	the	question	when	will	there	be	vaccine
now	the	development	of	the	vaccine	has	made	great	progress
in	thailand	there	is	already	monkey	injection
abroad	began	to	experiment	in	humans
but	even	after	getting	the	vaccine	you	must	see	how	many	you	can	prevent	and	expecting	to	be
in	practice	must	be	fully	careful
because	the	situation	is	currently	unreliable
although	the	epidemic	in	europe	is	already	declining	but	went	violent	in	south	america	in	brazil	and	then	may	spread	to	africa
this	is	approaching	our	home	therefore	there	is	risk	in	the	imported	case	it	is	necessary	to	screen	well
including	careful	consideration	of	unlocking	with	economic	reasons	involved	too
in	the	treatment	of	in	america	the	use	of	faviviravir	which	is	expensive	and	rare	for	patients	with	severe	conditions
the	treatment	group	of	malaria	is	not	effective	enough
however	doctors	began	to	understand	the	possibilities	of	the	disease	and	the	process	of	treatment	better
causing	the	death	rate	to	be	around
which	most	of	the	elderly	people	with	chronic	illnesses	and	is	supportive	treatment
therefore	if	the	vaccine	was	invented	it	would	help	reduce	the	spread
less	seriousness	of	the	disease	and	if	there	is	no	imported	case	at	all	people	take	care	of	themselves	strictly	good	control	of	disease	good	tracking	and	tracking	less	chance	of	finding	the	sick	person	the	disease	will	dilute	by	itself
but	in	practice	locking	all	down	is	difficult	everyone	therefore	must	maintain	distance	wear	masks	wash	hands	frequently	avoiding	densely	populated	communities	until	vaccines	and	medicines	are	available
robotic	technology	with	medicine	siriraj	hospital	introduced	robotic	surgery	technology	for	the	first	time	in	thailand	in	surgical	treatment	for	over	patients
robotic	surgery	can	be	used	for	all	types	of	surgery	such	as	prostate	kidney	bladder	intestine	liver	pancreas	etc
by	having	precise	surgical	performance	with	magnifying	camera	more	stable	than	using	doctor	hand	as	well	as	able	to	access	small	area
importantly	it	can	be	used	in	telesurgery	surgery	to	reduce	the	risk	of	contact	between	patients	and	doctors	in	surgery	for	hiv	patients	or	infectious	diseases
however	at	present	there	are	still	limitations	with	high	expenses
from	the	reason	of	patent	the	only	manufacturer	in	the	world
in	the	future	when	the	patent	expires	prices	will	go	down	and	general	hospitals	can	use	it	future	medical	robotics	development	is	expected	to	increase	in	many	areas
for	example	robots	help	organize	medicines	under	the	supervision	of	pharmacist
the	robot	inquiries	about	the	patient	history	uses	ai	to	process	the	data	help	the	doctor	diagnose	and	plan	the	treatment	etc
code	of	practice	against	covid	dr	sittiporn	emphasized	the	strict	conduct	of	self	care	in	order	to	be	safe	from	covid	with	physical	distancing	wear	mask	wash	hands	often	avoid	congested	areas	or	randomly	take	risks	and	check	in
maintain	enough	health	and	rest	exercise	regularly	eat	healthy	food	far	away	from	cigarettes	and	drinking	alcohol
in	general	health	not	related	to	covid	dr	sittiporn	also	suggests	management	of	life	balance
take	care	of	the	state	of	mind	reduce	stress	effects	from	events	that	occur	in	this	phase
as	well	as	follow	the	news	and	information	on	health	knowledge	as	well

if	entrepreneurs	dont	know	who	the	target	is	how	product	or	service	is	good	for	the	target	how	much	the	monthly	expense	is	and	what	is	short	term	and	long	term	plan	they	need	to	find	the	solution	for	those	concerns	before	starting	the	business	and	organizing	the	plan
choose	the	wrong	target	group	and	dont	understand	customer	needs	that	is	the	worst	mistake
marketing	will	fail	if	the	target	is	wrong	because	advertising	and	public	relations	will	be	released	in	the	wrong	channels	content	and	promotion	arent	suitable	for	buyers
for	example	childrens	products	are	expensive	but	the	target	is	set	to	unaffordable	buyers
lack	of	marketing	expertise	dont	understand	marketing	well	enough	and	try	to	make	everyone	like	your	products
in	fact	not	everyone	will	like	the	same	product
you	need	to	set	your	business	in	the	right	position	and	define	clear	target
customer	needs	and	marketing	strategies	are	challenging	and	tough
many	entrepreneurs	often	make	mistakes	about	that
some	entrepreneurs	claim	that	their	products	are	excellent	but	theres	no	marketing	demand
some	make	the	wrong	forecasts	about	marketing	size	or	unreal	demand	or	too	little	demand
frequent	example	is	to	invest	big	amount	of	money	and	rush	manufacturing	and	stock	products	expecting	that	the	price	will	certainly	rise	in	the	near	future
in	fact	price	drops	because	market	demand	shrinks	so	it	leads	to	tremendous	loss	and	bankruptcy
lack	of	knowledge	and	experience	in	the	business	this	is	factor	that	mostly	found	to	ruin	the	business
each	industry	has	its	own	characteristic	and	it	needs	different	perceptions	in	order	to	manage	the	business	properly	and	efficiently
another	factor	is	how	well	entrepreneurs	can	drive	strategic	management	as	this	is	the	most	important	qualification	to	set	the	proper	direction	for	sustainable	success
lack	of	capability	to	change	the	changing	of	consumer	behavior	is	the	risk	factor	of	business	failure
the	familiar	example	is	the	shopping	behavior	of	thai	people	who	shift	to	online	shopping	more	as	its	convenient	no	need	to	travel	and	they	re	variety	of	products
entrepreneurs	who	are	still	running	the	business	in	traditional	ways	and	havent	adjusted	business	in	line	with	consumer	behavior	may	face	failure
accumulated	loss	this	can	lead	to	bankruptcy	whatever	size	your	business	is
that	means	the	business	faces	loss	every	year	due	to	several	reasons	such	as	entrepreneurs	cant	adjust	their	businesses	to	the	change	of	consumer	behavior	in	time	until	the	loss	outweighs	the	costs
lack	of	liquidity	this	is	major	cause	of	failure	because	the	business	regularly	faces	problems
if	you	dont	have	sufficient	credibility	your	business	will	lose	liquidity	and	you	may	need	loan	to	pay	your	debt
some	entrepreneurs	cant	get	out	of	all	debts	and	become	bankrupt	later
lack	of	delegation	this	happens	to	most	sme	entrepreneurs	who	like	to	manage	things	on	their	own	which	leads	to	no	progress	and	that	considered	the	negative	behavior	of	almost	all	entrepreneurs
even	though	they	hire	staff	they	dont	trust	them	and	believe	that	nobody	can	work	better	than	them
entrepreneurs	should	be	more	open	and	give	chance	to	those	who	are	capable	of	assisting	them
be	reminded	that	the	most	successful	entrepreneurs	cant	do	it	alone	lack	of	difference	the	business	will	be	at	risk	and	fall	into	price	cutting	competition	with	others	until	theres	no	profit	left
selling	the	same	items	as	competitors	and	follow	the	same	marketing	pattern	is	hard	to	create	added	value	to	survive	and	grow
fail	to	build	partners	dont	think	that	you	can	do	everything
find	well	matched	partners	to	grow	and	survive	together
gathering	business	partners	will	keep	the	business	strong	gain	full	support	and	enhance	the	skills	of	each	individual
overinvestment	this	may	depend	on	personal	taste	or	preference	from	many	angles
we	shouldnt	invest	in	things	that	dont	generate	sales	to	the	business	such	as	luxurious	name	cards	costly	websites	off	target	and	over	budget	advertising
overwhelming	expansion	of	entrepreneurs	is	often	found	in	investors	who	are	in	high	market	growth	situation	and	demand	outweighs	manufacturing	capability	or	circulating	funds
entrepreneurs	dont	want	to	miss	an	opportunity	and	are	certain	that	theyre	able	to	manage	and	solve	the	problems
the	business	will	lose	its	liquidity	and	then	fail	in	the	end
we	call	this	phenomenon	overtrading	which	is	normally	found	in	sme	entrepreneur	groups
overexpansion	entrepreneurs	expand	the	business	with	tremendous	amount	of	money	in	permanent	assets	expecting	that	sales	or	business	volume	will	be	high	enough	and	investment	size	is	worth	expanding
in	fact	its	contrary	as	the	business	volume	doesnt	turn	out	as	planned	or	they	re	some	unexpected	reasons	that	cause	market	shrinkage	so	sales	and	profit	go	down
after	that	they	cant	make	enough	cash	flow	to	return	principle	with	interest	for	their	loan	money
finally	the	business	gets	stuck	closes	down	and	becomes	bankrupt
many	people	dream	of	being	an	entrepreneur	but	the	path	to	success	is	not	bed	of	roses
they	need	great	effort	strong	intention	well	planning	vision	market	and	target	understanding	and	most	importantly	marketing	knowledge

entertainment	will	be	family	programs	such	as	super	ten	super	hundred	reflecting	the	needs	of	family	members	during	this	period
in	addition	khun	tip	also	mentioned	google	report	on	thai	behaviors	watching	youtube	during	social	distancing
thai	people	watch	youtube	learn	online	on	various	matters
followed	by	cooking	with	search	for	recipes	such	as	pancakes	weight	loss	food	steamed	eggs	and	stir	fried	basil	respectively
reflecting	that	thai	people	are	interested	in	developing	themselves	in	various	fields	including	finding	activities	to	do	during	the	covid	period	skills	that	must	have	after	covid	according	to	alvin	toffler	people	without	education	in	the	st	century	are	not	people	who	can	read	or	write	but	people	who	are	unable	to	learn
or	removing	previously	learned	things	to	learn	new	things	when	asked	khun	tip	after	what	did	david	have	to	change	the	way	he	thinks	adjust	his	attitude	and	develop	skills
khun	tip	has	the	following	views	unlearnbecause	the	original	formula	original	knowledge	original	expertise	is	no	longer	available	in	the	situation	right	now
covid	taught	that	there	is	absolutely	nothing
there	are	always	unforeseen	events
like	the	business	plan	before	it	was	possible	to	take	months
but	after	covid	for	only	weeks	it	was	achieved
urgently	need	to	be	adjusted	sometimes	must	change	to	new	business
such	as	the	story	of	suit	tailor	shop	called	suit	cube	which	employs	more	than	people
when	covid	had	to	close	the	shop
the	owners	find	solution	to	how	to	keep	the	employees	to	have	money	and	still	have	work	to	do
then	brainstorm	and	finally	come	to	the	conclusion	that	cooking	is	the	way
the	owner	therefore	held	contest	on	the	menu	of	the	winner	menu	which	is	grilled	pork	with	fermented	fish
it	appears	that	they	were	able	to	sell
the	customers	are	an	old	customer	who	used	to	tailor	suit	at	the	shop	showing	that	during	this	situation	he	must	do	what	he	does	not	familiar	with	not	an	expert
but	everyone	is	ready	to	learn	and	start	again
if	still	sticking	to	the	old	expertise	that	must	sell	suits	may	not	be	able	to	conduct	business	until	now
relearnkhun	tip	sees	that	there	are	some	things	to	learn	more	learn	or	skills	that	must	be	re	learned	new	learning	must	also	include	skills	like	learning	more	or	relearn	recommend	favorite	books	reading	is	the	fastest	learning	experience	in	the	past
khun	tip	as	reading	lover	would	like	to	suggest	his	favorite	book	to	try	and	read
the	first	book	the	hard	thing	about	hard	things	was	written	by	ben	horowitz	the	legendary	ceo	and	investor	of	silicon	valley	that	had	been	through	the	monsoon	in	the	bubble	start	up	business
khun	tip	said	that	normally	the	books	are	written	only	from	beautiful	perspectives	and	good	comments
but	for	this	book	the	opposite
such	difficult	matter	is	not	to	set	great	goals
but	it	about	releasing	people	when	you	don	reach	that	goal	or	difficult
it	not	about	finding	talent
but	dealing	with	when	smart	people	begin	to	demand	things	you	can	give
second	book	overhaul	the	rework	idea
written	by	jason	fried	david	heinemeier	hansson
translated	by	asaya	takadkul
khun	tip	said	that	this	book	says	that	the	business	mindset	will	miss	important	business	themes
dismantling	all	methods	of	thinking	in	the	workplace	helps	to	wake	up	the	mind
third	book	make	people	hooked
written	by	nir	eyal	ryan	hoover
translated	by	virote
the	book	will	talk	about	the	factors	that	make	customers	want	to	re	use	products	and	services
the	th	book	my	life	as	coach	was	written	by	sikvek	breake	which	reflects	the	way	of	thinking	as	leader
khun	tip	said	that	she	can	learn	from	reading	this	book
suggesting	ways	to	cope	with	the	new	normal	style	of	smes	khun	tip	compares	the	business	to	driving	car	that	when	driving	race	car	having	to	bend	at	high	speed	our	eyes	have	to	look	at	the	road
not	looking	at	the	wall
this	means	having	to	focus	on	problem	solving	not	focus	on	things	that	we	cannot	control	or	fix
that	means	that	when	doing	business	when	encountering	problems	and	obstacles	that	cannot	be	resolved	there	is	no	need	to	solve	them
do	only	editable	that	is	the	best	in	addition	khun	tip	mentioned	about	seeing	other	people	sell	good	things	and	sell	as	follows
in	addition	khun	tip	mentioned	seeing	other	people	sell	good	things	and	sell	as	follows	what	is	popular	means	that	we	are	too	late
let	us	think	again	about	what	the	next	trend	will	be
what	will	continue	this	hit	our	business	will	survive
including	when	asked	how	to	make	online	marketing	successful	what	to	do
khun	tip	answered	success	or	failure	it	not	just	about	skills	but	in	the	mindset	that	is	determined	not	to	give	up	and	be	successful
successful	online	marketing	in	this	era	in	addition	to	being	diligent	in	training	yourself	must	also	unlearn	by	abandoning	the	original	formula	leaving	the	same	expertise	relearn	to	learn	more	to	keep	up	to	date
and	finally	having	to	learn	new	things	both	digital	skill	and	solf	skill	will	make	the	business	grow	sustainably	and	steadily	through	this	covid	crisis
source	scbtv	new	online	mindset	changing	mindset	in	new	online	marketing	via	facebook	scb	thailand	may	for	sme	new	digital	banking	platform	for	enhancing	the	good	financial	experience	for	business	customers
under	the	economic	slowdown	which	is	result	of	the	trade	war	and	the	global	economy	the	tourism	sector	in	our	country	has	been	affected	by	the	number	of	tourists	in	some	markets	decreased
or	some	markets	adjust	travel	groups
for	example	from	the	chinese	market	from	traveling	as	large	group	tour	with	the	tour	leader	changing	to	more	independent	self	travel	also	known	as	free	individual	traveler
causing	us	to	see	the	number	of	chinese	tourists	falling
in	addition	to	the	economic	overview	mentioned	above	there	are	still	factors	of	the	baht	appreciation
making	thailand	as	tourist	destination	when	compared	to	other	tourist	cities	in	the	surrounding	area	so	we	seem	to	have	higher	prices	due	to	the	changing	currency
and	if	the	hotel	business	will	be	able	to	overcome	these	situations	what	factors	will	be	considered	from	the	bank	viewpoint	through	the	senior	director	real	estate	and	hotel	business	by	khun	kongkaew	boonprasit	and	khun	rachid	chairat	an	accountant	who	own	famous	platforms	like	accrevo
how	they	will	give	advice	to	hotel	operators
let	see	one	by	one
for	banks	the	key	factors	for	successful	business	operations	are	concise	investment	planning	for	newly	started	projects	during	construction	during	this	period	it	is	important	to	get	the	construction	project	to	be	correct	according	to	the	plan	and	within	the	planned	time	frame
in	order	to	control	the	expenses	from	escalating
and	when	the	construction	was	completed	they	were	able	to	apply	for	hotel	business	license	correctly
including	other	related	licenses	as	well	the	construction	project	was	completed	but	unable	to	request	license	which	means	that	the	project	cannot	run	the	business	under	the	law
operating	period	at	this	stage	the	bank	will	focus	on	the	hotel	marketing	and	sales	plans	of	how	the	plan	will	be	implemented
will	be	able	to	develop	and	build	stable	business	growth	based	on	the	common	goals	between	the	bank	and	customers	or	not
in	addition	during	this	service	opening	phase	another	important	indicator	that	reflects	the	quality	of	the	business	is	receiving	and	payment	management	which	in	the	end	is	liquidity	of	the	business	through	cash	flow	numbers	that	will	enable	the	business	to	proceed	smoothly	and	securely
from	the	above	points	of	view	the	bank	has	products	and	services	that	can	support	those	interested	in	investing	in	the	hotel	business	at	all	stages	of	the	project	development	until	when	it	is	open	for	service
and	we	have	great	platform	to	help	you	manage	your	liquidity	and	convenient	and	economical	inbound	and	outbound	management	systems
this	time	looking	at	the	perspective	of	the	accountants	of	the	popular	platform	accrevo	what	are	the	factors	that	will	make	the	hotel	business	grow	steadily
khun	rachid	chairat	gave	the	opinion	that	the	accounting	system	is	system	that	even	though	many	people	think	it	is	difficult	but	these	are	important	things	for	tightening	the	business	and	reducing	management	risks
which	if	the	entrepreneur	has	good	accounting	system	whether	used	through	the	platform	or	through	other	tools	the	benefits	of	having	good	accounting	system	will	reduce	the	problem	of	managing	information	or	documents	help	save	time	and	document	costs
and	is	also	preparing	to	enter	electronic	transactions
the	data	can	be	analyzed	for	business	planning	and	most	importantly	establishing	credibility	with	dealing	with	financial	institutions	and	for	substantial	tax	deduction	with	documents	stored	systematically
finally	khun	rachid	also	gives	advice	on	creating	single	account	that	in	addition	to	systematic	accounting	the	entrepreneurs	should	do	business	in	single	account
or	the	preparation	of	accounts	and	financial	statements	in	accordance	with	the	condition	of	only	one	set	of	businesses
will	make	the	business	more	reliable	resulting	in	more	efficient	business	management
it	is	considered	that	such	entrepreneurs	are	part	of	supporting	the	sme	business	to	grow	steadily	and	strongly	in	the	future
all	of	the	above	is	not	difficult	for	entrepreneurs	in	any	way
it	may	just	take	time	to	lay	out	the	structure	of	various	matters	more	carefully
but	when	having	an	investment	structure	management	structure	clear	financial	management	project	business	operation	can	go	forward	fully	do	not	worry	in	any	way	and	most	importantly	scb	is	ready	to	travel	with	all	entrepreneurs	to	be	partners	investors	and	good	advisors	along	the	route

if	you	mention	the	menu	stir	fried	crab	with	curry	powder	must	be	given	to	somboon	seafood	the	original	restaurant	for	the	deliciousness	of	fried	crab	with	curry	powder
using	crabs	from	the	gulf	of	thailand	stir	fried	with	rich	curry	powder	sauce	mellow	taste	pleasing	to	thai	and	foreign	people
until	the	world	media	like	cnn	praised	it	for	the	most	delicious	and	delicious	curry	crab	in	asia
there	is	also	menu	that	is	famous	for	baked	shrimp	with	glass	noodles	that	received	michelin	guide	award
and	tom	yum	with	river	prawn	award	winning	local	food	that	cannot	be	missed	from	the	tourism	authority	of	thailand
so	it	is	no	wonder	why	somboon	seafood	is	one	of	the	destinations	for	foodies	and	tourists	from	all	over	the	world	visiting	thailand
and	it	is	also	store	that	has	been	used	to	welcome	countless	visitors	residents	city	guests	and	celebrities	from	around	the	world
khun	somboon	khun	nok	the	son	of	the	restaurant	owner	who	has	the	same	age	and	has	the	same	name	as	the	restaurant	tells	us	the	story	of	doing	business	through	the	crisis	overcome	challenges	and	stand	up	to	this	day	for	us	to	listen
from	small	dessert	to	the	legendary	big	dish	before	becoming	restaurant	somboon	seafood	khun	nok	father	and	mother	opened	shaved	ice	and	the	duck	porridge	restaurant	in	sam	yan	area	before
when	they	began	to	have	more	children	khun	noks	father	therefore	wants	to	switch	to	selling	food	that	generates	more	income	for	his	family
but	coming	later	and	wanted	to	win	must	be	special
therefore	invented	unique	menu	of	fried	crab	with	curry	powder
use	sea	crab	instead	of	blue	crab	and	came	up	with	new	recipe	for	curry	powder	sauce	to	have	uniquely	delicious	taste
auspicious	opening	of	thai	style	seafood	restaurant	with	chinese	food	was	opened	in	and	named	the	new	restaurant	after	khun	nok
which	was	born	in	the	same	year	that	the	restaurant	opened
the	origin	of	the	name	somboon	went	back	to	when	it	was	confectionery	and	duck	porridge	restaurant
khun	noks	mother	at	that	time	was	pregnant
there	was	soldier	who	was	regular	customer	of	the	store
he	told	her	the	unborn	child	will	be	boy
and	if	born	give	the	name	of	sor	in	front
will	it	be	by	chance	or	because	of	miracles
no	one	knows
the	child	was	born	as	real	man
but	after	giving	birth	to	khun	nok	no	one	saw	this	customer	again	the	beginning	of	the	branch	expansion	somboon	seafood	first	shop	was	small	shop	adjacent	to	the	fence	of	chulalongkorn	university
most	of	the	customers	are	people	working	in	sam	yan	and	silom	area
later	chulalongkorn	university	informed	me	that	there	would	be	expropriation	of	land	in	the	sam	yan	area
khun	nok	father	and	mother	had	to	look	for	way	to	open	new	store	to	accommodate	the	first	store	that	is	closing	by	looking	at	the	location	at	surawong
and	this	is	the	first	step	in	opening	new	store	since	you	didn	have	the	idea	of	expanding	before
after	expropriating	the	land	in	the	sam	yan	area	chulalongkorn	university	has	given	banthat	thong	area	to	open	new	stores
somboon	seafood	therefore	opened	another	branch	at	banthat	thong	road
later	khun	nok	sister	saw	good	location	on	ratchadaphisek	road	and	opened	another	branch	here
and	followed	by	udomsuk	branch	as	the	fourth	branch	respectively	the	first	four	branches	of	somboon	seafood	are	all	standalone	branches
therefore	when	choosing	location	for	the	shop	it	is	important	to	look	at	the	road	that	people	drive	home	mainly
so	that	customers	can	easily	decide	to	turn	their	car	into	the	store	do	not	waste	time	in	the	turn
and	this	is	small	matter	that	is	the	secret	to	success	the	first	step	of	somboon	seafood
jigsaw	puzzles	that	must	be	completed	doing	business	is	like	jigsaw	puzzle
if	complete	you	will	see	clear	picture
khun	nok	told	about	the	mistakes	in	running	his	own	business
during	that	time	as	young	man	he	had	high	self	confidence	but	little	experience
did	the	business	just	the	way	he	wanted
he	wanted	to	decorate	the	restaurant	at	udomsuk	to	look	modern	in	the	millennium	style	to	get	customer	attention
but	it	appeared	that	the	customer	refused	to	enter	the	restaurant	because	it	seems	to	luxurious
it	became	lesson	for	khun	nok	to	learn	that	to	start	doing	whatever	you	must	first	go	into	the	area	to	find	out	who	the	customer	is	what	they	like	and	what	kind	of	lifestyle	they	have
then	go	to	design	the	store	to	suit	the	customer
restaurant	with	touch	of	reach	makes	it	easier	for	customers	to	make	choices
khun	nok	also	applied	his	father	idea	of	keeping	small
because	when	the	restaurant	owner	makes	himself	small	no	one	will	know
therefore	able	to	easily	disguise	and	reach	customers
by	entering	the	restaurant	and	keep	listening	to	what	real	customers	think	and	look	at	the	menu	and	are	they	have	question
keep	an	eye	on	how	to	order	food
when	found	that	the	food	photos	and	the	menu	names	do	not	match
was	brought	to	improve	there	are	numbers	added	to	make	it	easier	to	order	etc
the	path	of	opening	restaurant	in	mall	with	the	price	of	land	continuously	rising	in	many	areas
causing	the	need	to	stop	opening	the	stand	alone	branch
together	with	that	period	the	construction	of	chamchuri	square	began	to	take	shape
khun	nok	father	therefore	said	that	if	opening	the	first	branch	in	the	mall	let	open	where	it	had	been	before
because	somboon	seafood	the	first	restaurant	was	at	sam	yan
opening	the	first	store	in	department	store	at	chamchuri	square	is	like	returning	to	the	old	place	where	the	family	was	bound
khun	nok	told	us	about	going	to	the	area	to	open	branch	in	department	store	that	he	spends	months	on	the	occasion	provided	each	day	to	personally	explore	the	customer	base
for	example	siam	square	one	branch	not	just	group	of	teenagers	but	there	are	still	groups	of	tourists	who	travel	bts	likes	to	dress	comfortably	in	shirts	shorts	carry	camera	come	to	naraya	shop
therefore	the	design	of	the	store	must	make	this	group	of	customers	feel	comfortable
there	is	space	to	place	shopping	bags
while	the	nearby	central	world	branch	is	group	of	chinese	tourists	walking	from	the	erawan	shrine
and	often	come	with	large	tour	groups	or	come	together	as	family
the	news	distribution	must	therefore	inform	the	tour	company	that	somboon	seafood	has	opened	at	central	world
there	is	large	round	table	to	accommodate	customers	who	come	as	group
before	deciding	where	to	open	branch	going	to	the	area	embedded	in	that	area	to	find	real	customers	is	very	important	to	khun	nok
as	in	the	case	of	the	central	world	branch	has	entered	the	area	walk	around	for	about	months	to	make	sure	when	the	store	opens	there	will	be	customers
being	observant	also	allows	khun	nok	to	see	the	behavior	of	different	customers	in	each	group
for	example	japanese	people	like	to	eat	steamed	shrimp	fried	morning	glory	and	fried	crab	meat	with	curry	powder	because	they	don	like	it	break	the	crab	shell	themselves
koreans	love	to	order	sour	soup	because	it	is	very	close	to	kimchi	soup
chinese	tourists	enjoy	desserts	like	mango	sticky	rice	before	and	after	meals	and	like	to	order	food	that	focuses	on	large	dishes
as	for	the	westerners	they	will	not	eat	shared	food
but	who	will	order	it
in	doing	business	it	is	important	to	know	them	to	know	us	in	order	to	truly	reach	and	understand	our	customers
strategy	through	the	crisis	overcome	challenges	after	opening	more	branches	in	the	mall	khun	nok	therefore	focuses	on	tourist	marketing	mainly
especially	the	largest	group	of	chinese	tourists
until	the	chinese	economy	slowed	from	the	trade	war
fewer	tourists	in	thailand
khun	nok	then	suspended	the	opening	of	new	branch	first
then	come	to	think	of	ways	to	make	customers	think	about	somboon	seafood	as	the	first	choice
but	came	across	the	covid	situation	before
the	spread	of	covid	rapidly	making	it	necessary	to	prepare	to	anticipate	every	possibility	in	advance	what	will	happen
if	the	airport	is	closed	the	country	is	closed	all	tourists	disappear
it	is	conscious	look	forward
to	find	solution	for	the	family	business	together	with	everyone	in	the	company
when	the	airport	shutdown	was	announced	the	mall	closed	despite	the	problem	of	half	the	revenues	from	the	tourist	group	disappeared
but	the	employees	problems	must	be	resolved	first
because	employees	are	the	key	is	like	business	assistant
everyone	will	be	taken	good	care	of
no	one	left	behind
able	to	come	and	eat	at	the	restaurant	for	all	three	meals
anyone	who	has	financial	problems	without	accommodation	can	come	to	sleep	on	the	upper	floor	of	the	restaurant
during	the	closing	announcement	although	the	mall	allowed	to	do	delivery	there	were	obstacles	in	the	transportation	of	raw	materials	and	items
khun	nok	then	temporarily	closed	the	branches	in	the	department	store	and	used	all	stand	alone	branches	as	food	hub	for	delivery
there	is	cook	alternately	helping	with	the	work
as	for	the	staff	at	the	department	store	khun	nok	announced	request	to	volunteer	for	male	employee	with	motorbike	and	use	google	maps	to	help	deliver	food
the	packaging	for	food	delivery	was	thought	to	be	done	right	then
find	many	kinds	of	packaging	in	the	market	try	and	get	it	wrong	and	find	the	best	way	to	deliver	food	to	customers
to	provide	customers	with	pleasant	experience
but	by	being	beginner	in	doing	delivery	inevitably	mistakes	are	commonplace
when	the	customer	complaints	thanks	to	the	voice	from	the	customer	makes	it	known	that	there	are	errors	and	can	be	fixed	at	the	point
which	the	main	problem	was	found	in	the	food	containing	the	water	when	it	reaches	the	customer	hand	and	spills	it	with	other	food
causing	the	need	to	switch	to	separate	food	sealing	custom	made	seal	bags	to	fit	each	type	of	food
until	it	comes	out	as	packaging	in	standard	format	adjusting	strategies	for	the	covid	situation	when	covid	causing	the	need	to	maintain	distance	between	them	the	large	plate	of	shared	food	was	therefore	reduced
turned	into	bento	set	you	can	choose	dishes	for	one	person	full	and	value
when	the	covid	situation	intensifies	there	is	campaign	to	stay	at	home	and	stop	the	infection	for	the	nation
many	organizations	have	policies	for	employees	to	work	from	home
therefore	set	of	delivery	meals	for	the	family	to	eat	together	while	working	at	home
customers	can	choose	the	menu	in	the	set	as	well
it	is	an	adaptation	to	the	actual	situation	that	occurs
think	about	how	to	cope	with	and	solve	problems	with	consciousness
along	with	the	idea	of	making	food	delivery	order	system
after	previously	thinking	about	it	but	haven	done	it	yet
somboon	seafood	has	adjusted	until	there	is	variety	of	delivery	channels	whether	it	is	the	store	line	line	man	grab	food	or	the	call	center	at	etc
after	the	unlock	down	the	restaurant	is	open	for	dine	in
each	branch	has	new	seat	to	be	spaced	more	apart
as	for	who	came	together	can	still	sit	at	the	same	table	at	distance
during	one	year	from	now	khun	nok	has	set	sales	target	that	must	achieve	half	of	the	pre	covid	period
but	this	half	is	much	more	difficult	and	challenging	problem
because	online	customer	groups	are	groups	where	every	shop	wants	to	win
therefore	having	to	find	way	to	share	customers	online	to	replace	as	many	of	the	same	tourists	as	possible
ideas	for	doing	business	successfully	khun	nok	is	movie	buff	who	watched	countless	thai	and	foreign	movies
khun	nok	favorite	story	is	game	of	thrones	which	is	full	fledged	series
and	get	an	idea	of	how	to	apply	it	to	the	business
khun	nok	used	to	do	questionnaire	to	find	out	what	character	he	is	in	the	series
it	appears	that	it	fell	to	the	character	named	terian	times
this	character	is	planner
the	person	behind	helping	king	who	is	very	similar	to	him
because	somboon	seafood	was	founded	by	his	father	and	khun	nok	is	responsible	for	planning	the	strategy	for	his	father
so	everything	must	be	thoughtful	because	every	decision	it	can	always	make	positive	and	negative	impact
it	is	like	the	decision	of	character	tyrian	who	has	decided	to	do	something
everything	has	its	consequences
so	when	looking	at	the	characters	had	to	look	back	and	see	ourselves
what	kind	of	person	do	we	want	to	be
or	what	kind	of	businesspeople	that	we	choose
and	when	having	to	meet	the	challenges	of	life	what	khun	nok	chooses	to	do	is	staying	conscious	in	the	real	situation	and	find	way	out	of	that	situation	as	quickly	as	possible

we	can	consider	that	the	packaging	has	been	adjusted	up	and	down	according	to	the	market	demand

the	situation	of	covid	causing	the	economy	to	have	wide	impact
small	and	medium	sized	businesses	or	smes	were	affected	due	to	the	declining	demand	for	their	products	and	services
resulting	in	lower	income	while	expenditures	are	the	same
have	liability	and	lack	of	liquidity	in	debt	repayment
according	to	the	bank	of	thailand	data	one	third	of	all	smes	suffer	losses	with	one	in	five	smes	experiencing	losses	that	have	closed	their	businesses
although	the	government	sector	and	the	bank	of	thailand	have	already	issued	measures	in	accordance	with	the	financial	aid	act	for	smes	who	have	been	affected	by	the	covid	virus
however	long	term	smes	need	to	be	adjusted	in	many	directions
this	is	to	enable	smes	to	continue	its	business	during	the	change
presenting	products	or	services	online	in	order	to	be	more	in	line	with	the	behavior	of	consumers	who	turn	to	online	shopping	because	they	want	to	access	products	or	services	quickly
modifying	to	sell	products	online	in	addition	to	keeping	the	same	customer	groups	promoting	products	or	services	through	various	online	channels	also	helps	to	become	known	in	wide
thus	enabling	more	customer	base	expansion	as	well
in	addition	sending	messages	to	customers	regularly
whether	to	report	promotional	activities	or	news	from	the	store	will	help	maintain	the	relationship	between	the	operator	and	the	customer
it	also	helps	create	opportunities	for	customers	to	purchase	additional	products	or	services	in	the	future
develop	business	into	full	commerce	develop	business	into	full	commerce
start	by	improving	the	content	on	the	website	by	providing	clear	and	complete	product	details
until	customers	feel	like	they	have	come	to	see	the	product	for	themselves
systematic	checking	of	inventory	and	showing	the	remaining	amount	clearly
to	ensure	customers	that	the	product	is	ready	for	immediate	delivery
market	and	consumer	analysis	using	statistical	data	for	timely	strategy	adjustments
efficient	delivery	of	products	and	delivery	tracking	systems	in	order	to	deliver	products	to	customers	in	perfect	condition
or	even	convenient	fast	and	secure	payment	channel	all	of	which	create	new	and	impressive	purchasing	experience	for	consumers
build	alliances	with	other	smes
it	is	to	help	each	other	get	through	the	crisis
such	as	restaurants	negotiate	requests	for	delivery	services	from	nearby	smes	this	makes	restaurants	earn	more	because	they	can	deliver	food	quickly
at	the	same	time	the	delivery	service	business	has	grown	from	higher	delivery	cycles	each	day
thus	benefiting	both	parties
in	addition	sharing	knowledge	or	resources	in	the	sme	group	can	be	considered	as	helping	to	develop	holistic	sme	business
for	example	entrepreneurs	share	their	knowledge	to	create	online	content	to	attract	customers
or	designs	in	order	to	allow	photos	to	clearly	show	the	strength	of	the	product
or	in	case	the	operator	has	free	space	may	allow	other	entrepreneurs	to	show	their	products	without	charging	rental	fees
modify	and	enhance	business	models	helping	smes	through	the	crisis
for	example	changing	part	of	restaurant	into	market	for	selling	products
bringing	wholesale	consumer	products	to	retail	in	order	to	suit	the	purchasing	power	of	consumers
production	of	online	teaching	materials	in	addition	to	the	regular	classes	of	tutoring	schools
extension	of	service	hours	or	hour	customer	service
working	from	home	to	reduce	office	rental	costs
study	the	market	and	consumer	behavior	regularly	help	sme	entrepreneurs	adjust	their	strategies	in	timely	manner
it	may	collect	statistics	or	information	from	online	questionnaires
or	customer	satisfaction	survey	after	purchasing	product	or	using	service
and	keep	an	eye	on	market	trends	in	any	direction	in	order	to	modify	or	add	products	or	services	to	meet	the	needs
including	self	examination	with	questions	to	initiate	new	products	or	services	regardless	of	whether	the	sme	operator	will	change	in	any	direction
an	important	factor	that	should	be	kept	in	mind	is	to	be	prepared	for	future	changes
and	the	ability	to	respond	quickly	and	efficiently	to	changes
and	with	the	readiness	of	sme	entrepreneurs	no	matter	any	further	changes	they	are	not	too	difficult	to	cope	with
for	sme
to	exporting	goods	abroad	is	great	dream	for	many	entrepreneurs
some	people	struggle	to	achieve	success	but	some	people	must	extinguish	their	dreams
let	imagine	that	the	market	outside	of	our	country	is	huge	purchase
how	many	times	bigger	compared	to	that	we	have	sold	in	the	country
but	to	export	goods	outside	the	country	its	not	that	difficult	but	also	not	easy
because	they	are	many	steps	such	as	product	type	the	market	we	go	to	promotion	our	product	and	including	documents	and	customs	clearance
these	are	the	subjects	that	entrepreneurs	need	to	study	deeply	in	detail
or	consult	professional	is	the	best	way
for	those	who	want	to	export	goods	to	sell	outside	the	country	but	still	do	not	know	where	to	start	from
the	following	is	major	consideration	must	know	where	to	export	how	much	demand	in	that	market	what	is	our	product	how	to	export	it	what	is	the	payment	method	etc
entrepreneurs	may	need	to	answer	the	following	questions	first
the	export	method	before	that	had	to	travel	to	present	the	products	at	trade	show	in	various	countries
took	the	product	there	and	sold	directly	or	found	representative	in	that	country
all	these	methods	could	take	lot	of	time
but	today	it	has	been	exported	in	more	convenient	way	that	is	export	with	online	channels
the	easiest	way	is	to	have	your	own	website	which	the	online	world	can	now	connect	to	all	around	the	world
if	we	customize	the	site	to	it	easy	to	find	in	various	ways	such	as	seo	classified	marketing	email	marketing	facebook	marketing	and	twitter
it	will	help	customers	find	us	easily
or	we	may	find	customers	by	promoting	products	by	link	our	websites	on	other	sites	that	may	provide	free	of	charge
it	is	other	way	to	save	money
but	there	is	another	way	that	is	considered	an	interesting	and	rather	direct	online	channel	that	is	to	join	the	market	place	of	various	countries	that	allowed	us	to	sell	the	product	there
but	most	of	these	websites	are	also	marketplaces	in	each	country	and	can	be	both	free	and	paid
these	marketplaces	are	classified	as	country	based	such	as	amazon	or	alibaba	or	global	sources	global	market	place
to	list	the	products	in	these	marketplaces	is	like	making	an	online	catalog	of	those	countries
the	second	is	the	vertical	base	or	industry	base	is	the	market	place	by	product	type
for	example	food	item	has	vertical	base	that	gathers	food	vendors	or	product	sold	directly	from	the	factory
the	vertical	marketplace	vendors	can	bring	goods	into	the	list	itself
the	more	we	are	in	the	markets	the	more	we	have	our	branches
the	advice	now	is	to	have	the	person	responsible	for	this	directly	act	as	virtual	sales
can	open	branches	on	the	vertical	marketplace	around	the	world
if	you	decide	to	use	an	online	channel	product	cataloging	needs	to	be	interesting	and	attractive	business	content	and	credibility	are	of	paramount	importance
the	key	details	of	business	such	as	who	we	are	how	long	have	we	opened
what	standards	that	we	received	the	clear	details	of	the	goods	etc
for	those	who	want	to	export	online	may	start	asking	for	advice	from	scb	who	has	held	the	seminar	scb	joins	amazon	dhl	and	ditp	with	ecommerce	thailand	connects	business	opportunities	with	ecommerce	to	the	global	market
or	visit	alibaba	website	and	global	sources
to	simply	find	an	online	marketplace	for	country	level	try	searching	by	country	and	then	follow	by	marketplace
or	for	vertical	search	with	the	industry	name	and	follow	by	marketplace
the	advantage	of	vertical	is	that	it	often	meets	customers	in	an	industry
to	be	ahead	of	competitors	in	today	market	cannot	do	the	same	approach	anymore
must	open	the	market	to	the	widest	possible	in	simple	way	such	as	online	channels
and	in	the	next	step	can	connect	the	online	world	with	the	offline	world
do	not	forget	to	focus	on	the	brand	because	it	determines	the	value	of	product	and	the	technology	must	be	used	in	the	production	process	to	increase	efficiency

smes	the	standard
can	tiktok	be	used	for	marketing	creating	great	content	and	growing	sales
most	people	may	think	tiktok	is	just	an	app	to	create	dancing	and	hilarious	clips	for	teenagers
in	fact	if	tiktok	is	effectively	used	and	meets	the	target	group	itll	be	powerful	marketing	tool	that	can	gain	awareness	and	grow	sales	enormously
we	will	share	real	experience	and	cases	from	dr	ice	tirasan	sahatsapas	the	owner	of	soda	printingg	that	tiktok	is	successfully	used	as	marketing	tool	with	the	concept	just	one	gift	in	the	world	and	grows	huge	sales
lets	see	how	tiktok	works
business	before	tiktok	dr	ice	said	that	soda	printingg	is	small	brand	from	petchburi
its	business	is	image	printing	on	canvas	offering	home	delivery	service	with	the	concept	just	one	gift	in	the	world
at	first	the	business	might	sound	so	simple	but	customers	experienced	the	product	as	gift
when	the	business	started	there	was	no	hi	or	facebook
after	while	its	time	for	bb	facebook	so	marketing	tools	have	changed	according	to	social	status
thus	entrepreneurs	must	know	where	their	customers	are	and	how	their	businesses	will	tie	in	with	tools	and	connect	to	customers
the	key	is	how	to	make	customers	find	us
dr	ice	added	that	the	sales	model	is	changing	now	and	many	businesses	have	entered	into	more	commerce	platforms	but	he	believes	that	line	is	still	an	effective	tool	in	thailand
in	he	set	up	line	calling	team	to	support	customer	inquiries	as	the	key	is	to	make	customers	feel	that	they	talk	to	only	one	person
product	promotions	are	not	enough	but	the	backend	must	also	be	efficient	for	example	preparing	faqs	and	creating	friendliness	for	customers
when	facebook	first	launched	dr	ice	boost	the	post	on	facebook	and	it	worked	tremendously	well	with	baht	as	cost	per	day	and	then	finally	increased	to	one	hundred	thousand	baht
he	could	penetrate	to	large	number	of	customers	with	only	two	hundred	thousand	baht	per	day	or	million	baht	month
facebook	was	the	only	tool	he	used	at	that	time
later	facebooks	algorithm	was	adjusted	and	the	visual	rate	was	less	than
he	didnt	want	to	stick	with	the	same	old	method	so	it	was	time	to	find	new	channels
in	dr	ice	traveled	to	china	and	saw	few	chinese	crews	were	taking	video
he	found	out	later	that	it	was	streaming	created	by	the	tiktok	app	but	he	didnt	know	what	it	was
when	he	was	back	in	thailand	he	found	tiktok	has	been	popular	and	recognized	its	logo	then	he	knew	its	tiktok
the	beginning	of	tiktok	marketing	after	knowing	tiktok	dr	ice	studied	more	and	found	that	children	housewives	and	noodle	sellers	who	knew	nothing	about	technology	played	tiktok
he	realized	that	this	app	can	reach	so	many	people	and	its	contents	are	varied	short	and	attractive
when	teaching	at	private	university	he	assigned	the	students	to	create	clips	on	tiktok	and	submitted	them	to	him	by	midnight
his	students	didnt	even	know	about	tiktok	but	sent	the	clips	to	him	in	the	evening
the	students	could	use	the	tool	right	away	even	it	was	their	first	trial
tiktok	songs	are	in	good	beat	and	rhythm	and	also	catchy	to	the	audiences	ears
dr	ice	explored	all	those	song	lyrics	and	found	them	watched	by	million	views	he	kept	on	following	up	more	clips
tiktok	is	full	of	creative	ideas	so	he	considered	with	his	team	to	use	tiktok	as	marketing	tool
they	realized	whether	its	possible	to	motivate	customers	to	create	their	own	content
challenge	customers	to	create	content	on	tiktok	when	proposing	customers	to	create	content	dr	ice	offered	baht	discount	for	tiktok	clip
all	the	clips	were	amazing	and	kept	coming	in
he	started	analyzing	factors	while	always	monitoring	customers	and	wondered	where	customers	saw	soda	printingg
in	customers	started	to	know	soda	printingg	from	tiktok	so	his	team	was	certain	that	this	app	has	worked	effectively
later	the	peak	of	the	campaign	happened	when	he	got	clip	from	customer
he	didnt	expect	that	clip	had	an	impact	until	he	received	lots	of	orders
in	days	that	clip	generated	pieces	of	order
the	whole	team	believed	that	tiktok	is	real	and	agreed	to	keep	tiktok	furthering
create	brand	growth	by	tiktok	within	the	first	month	soda	printingg	gained	million	views	and	more	creative	and	fun	clips	were	introduced
some	people	ordered	clips	as	gift	for	their	loved	ones
some	students	wanted	to	print	their	pictures	on	canvas
customer	clips	later	were	not	enough	to	support	the	brand	so	its	time	to	get	more	people	to	perform	tiktok	every	day	but	no	scripts	and	no	brief	about	functions	were	guided	only	brand	hashtag	is	added
more	creative	ideas	kept	coming
the	number	of	views	was	increased	to	million	in	million	views	in	and	million	views	at	present
tiktok	grew	high	number	of	sales	and	traffic	kept	coming	in
on	the	past	valentines	day	dr	ice	planned	to	use	valentinegift	and	it	appeared	that	of	that	hashtag	were	soda	printingg	and	customer	orders	were	increased
after	that	soda	printingg	formed	small	music	agency	to	support	young	talented	people	who	had	no	opportunity	and	budget
some	songs	gained	million	views	as	people	saw	their	tiktok	and	followed	those	songs
getting	to	know	customers	dr	ice	said	that	tiktok	allows	him	to	see	teenage	customers
these	groups	love	talking	about	love	and	chat	with	each	other	through	songs	and	use	tiktok	as	tool
he	then	produced	song	without	brand
normally	theres	only	one	hook	but	dr	ice	arranged	hooks	and	the	lyrics	consist	of	business	keywords	like	the	gift	image	promtpay
the	song	content	is	about	teenage	life	so	it	attracted	more	audience	in	the	same	generation
the	teenagers	took	the	songs	to	dance	and	that	created	more	viral
printed	pictures	on	brand	canvas	appear	in	the	clips	and	that	inspired	many	people	to	have	the	same	pictures	to	post	in	their	clips	and	sales	then	increased
dr	ice	suggested	that	successful	clip	should	have	clear	major	content	the	lyrics	can	be	adapted	to	keywords	and	the	song	must	be	sticky	music
if	you	know	these	tips	then	tiktok	can	help	marketing
before	jumping	into	tiktok	we	need	to	understand	how	thai	teenagers	communicate	with	each	other
dr	ice	has	noticed	that	those	who	play	tiktok	will	save	their	clips	and	then	post	them	on	facebook	or	ig	as	those	channels	gain	many	followers	therefore	they	will	gain	likes	more	than	posting	on	tiktok	especially	in	the	beginning
dr	ice	still	monitors	that	seconds	of	the	hook	is	suitable	for	tiktok	as	most	teenagers	will	save	this	clip	and	then	post	it	in	the	story
if	story	is	longer	than	seconds	its	clip	will	be	automatically	cut	off	into	two	parts
teenagers	will	delete	keywords	presented	after	seconds	as	they	wont	post	the	second	clip	once	divided
when	the	clip	is	connected	to	story	people	will	chat	in	message	and	that	becomes	an	additional	selling	channel
thats	why	dr	ice	has	produced	songs	on	several	occasions	like	valentine	mothers	and	fathers	day	and	graduation	day
he	has	approached	teenagers	who	want	to	create	both	rap	and	dance	music
those	teens	love	to	create	clips	in	their	bedroom	and	post	their	pictures	on	soda	printingg	canvas	as	background
when	people	see	those	pictures	they	want	to	order	such	pictures
dr	ice	believes	that	tiktok	not	only	creates	awareness	but	also	sales	and	we	should	be	both	the	giver	and	the	receiver	while	creating	engagement
when	someone	asks	where	can	order	these	pictures
those	teenagers	will	include	the	brand	in	their	answers
dr	ice	had	many	talks	to	them	and	are	familiar	with	them	so	he	realized	that	they	want	to	support	his	brand
he	said	we	cant	only	be	the	receiver	and	we	need	their	engagement	in	our	brand
he	offered	discount	code	with	teenagers	names	social	names	when	ordering	to	build	sense	of	belonging	and	make	them	proud	and	feel	cool
customers	who	are	their	friends	will	get	that	discount	and	those	who	create	clips	will	also	get	cash	back	so	their	posts	will	have	value	added
this	has	motivated	them	to	continually	create	better	content
at	present	dr	ice	has	over	teenager	networks	and	tiktok	clips	over	which	connect	to	new	selling	model	shoppertainment	strategy
those	teenagers	helped	brand	selling	through	streaming	and	that	led	to	sales	increase	and	the	advertising	budget	reduced
soda	printingg	could	penetrate	to	more	customers	and	has	supported	unemployed	teenagers	and	their	families	during	covid	dr	ice	received	lots	of	messages	requesting	for	support	of	tuition	fee
he	couldnt	help	all	of	them	but	with	the	code	distributed	to	them	they	could	pay	the	tuition	fee	within	days
some	of	them	could	earn	baht	per	month
this	brand	encouraged	them	to	grow	sales	without	stock	concern	and	created	an	exclusive	printed	design	on	canvas	for	them
they	feel	engaged	that	they	are	part	of	brand	and	enjoy	bringing	traffic	to	the	shop
dr	ice	concluded	that	whatever	channel	we	use	we	must	know	target	groups	well
we	must	understand	our	objectives	and	find	the	right	tools	in	line	with	targets	and	business
all	tools	must	connect	to	networks	as	we	cant	work	alone
our	business	can	be	highly	successful	like	soda	printingg	if	we	commit	to	all	key	principles	above	mentioned

lanna	charm	like	chiang	mai	occupying	the	hearts	of	both	thai	and	international	tourists	from	around	the	world	until	becoming	the	top	province	of	thailand	with	an	annual	tourism	income	of	over	million	baht
with	variety	of	tourist	attractions	both	natural	unique	history	and	culture
in	addition	to	being	outstanding	in	tourism	chiang	mai	is	still	in	the	top	spots
of	the	most	prosperous	province	in	the	country	therefore	not	surprising	that	many	people	want	to	move	to	settle	down	and	do	business	in	chiang	mai
of	course	one	of	the	businesses	that	many	people	aim	for	is	the	inevitable	restaurant	and	cafe	business
but	did	you	know	that	chiang	mai	is	the	province	with	the	nd	largest	number	of	restaurants	after	bangkok
therefore	running	restaurant	business	in	the	capital	city	of	lanna	to	make	them	prosper	is	not	easy
studying	information	well	before	you	start	dreaming	is	essential
where	to	open	restaurant
location	is	the	key
does	it	mean	that	we	should	open	restaurant	in	the	largest	district	the	most	prosperous	the	busiest
lets	look	at	this	information	first
quickly	decide	which	of	the	districts	of	chiang	mai	has	the	largest	number	of	restaurants	data	for
mueang	district	amount	xxx	restaurants	sunsai	amount	xx	restaurants	hang	dong	amount	xx	restaurants	sankampang	amount	xx	restaurants	maerim	amount	xx	restaurants	from	the	information	it	is	found	that	mueang	district	has	the	highest	competition
although	it	is	the	district	that	has	the	most	prosperity	they	re	the	busiest	people	are	the	most	but	the	competition	is	also	very	intense
and	if	looking	at	the	districts	which	district	has	the	most	newly	opened	restaurants	it	is	found	that	in	the	same	direction	which	is	muang	district	there	are	new	restaurants	open	san	sai	district	has	newly	opened	restaurants	hang	dong	has	restaurants	sankampang	has	stores	and	saraphi	district	has	newly	opened	restaurants
saraphi	district	is	interesting	that	originally	did	not	rank	in	the	district	with	many	restaurants
but	is	currently	growing	what	kind	of	restaurant	should	be	opened
aside	from	locations	that	must	be	decided	the	type	of	shop	is	another	important	issue
many	people	have	dreams	of	having	small	coffee	shop
somewhere	in	chiang	mai	or	open	pearl	milk	tea	shop	that	is	very	popular	this	hour	but	looking	at	this	information	first	may	make	you	think	again
from	the	data	the	coffee	shops	are	the	most	open	category	with	new	stores	but	the	growth	rate	is	only	which	may	indicate	the	saturation	of	this	business
while	there	are	newly	opened	pearl	milk	tea	stores	but	with	growth	rate	of	from	the	previous	year	showing	the	huge	boom	of	pearl	milk	tea	shops	and	the	number	of	competitors	that	have	multiplied
while	single	dish	has	newly	opened	restaurants	and	the	rate	increases	only	another	information	that	can	help	decide	which	restaurant	to	open
is	the	search	for	information	about	which	menus	are	searched	the	most	on	the	internet	as	follows	curried	noodle	soup	pork	dip	larb	spicy	salad	soft	boiled	rice	lightly	fermented	rice	noodles	sichuan	pepper	chicken	over	rice	pearl	milk	tea	boat	noodle	from	the	information	it	is	found	that	khao	soi	which	is	local	food	and	single	dish	has	the	highest	search	rate
other	than	that	other	menus	that	are	single	dish	such	as	rice	porridge	rice	noodles	chicken	rice	has	lot	of	searches	as	well
while	the	number	of	single	dish	restaurants	is	still	small	and	the	growth	rate	is	not	high	maybe	another	interesting	type	of	restaurant	due	to	the	demand	and	the	competition	is	not	very	high
adapting	to	technology	be	aware	of	modern	consumers	aside	from	studying	information	about	market	conditions	and	competition	updating	trends	about	modern	consumers	and	using	technology	for	efficient	restaurant	management	are	also	very	important
do	you	know	which	day	most	people	searched	for	information	about	restaurants	most
the	answer	is	sunday	which	is	twice	as	much	as	saturday	which	is	second
consumer	behavior	data	are	essential	for	restaurant	operators	in	today	world
because	modern	consumers	pay	more	attention	to	connecting	with	technology	searching	for	restaurant	information	and	reading	restaurant	reviews	through	apps	or	websites	before	deciding
therefore	having	restaurant	information	on	the	number	one	food	related	platform	like	wongnai	will	help	operators	connect	with	many	customers
in	addition	using	fully	integrated	restaurant	management	technology	like	wongnai	pos	which	has	full	functions	including	menus	ordering	food	billing	of	food	with	qr	code	at	the	end	connecting	to	food	delivery	with	line	man
connect	with	the	wongnai	app
have	good	membership	system
and	able	to	complete	sales	reports
restaurants	can	do	promotions	add	new	menus	update	pictures	edit	restaurant	information	in	real	time	which	helps	to	access	and	better	serve	customers	needs
including	the	in	store	management	with	image	rights	owning	successful	restaurant	business	may	not	be	easy
but	not	difficult	to	reach	if	doing	homework	well	studying	and	analyzing	all	round	information
understand	the	changing	trends	of	the	restaurant	business
understand	the	changing	behavior	and	needs	of	consumers	and	able	to	respond	to	new	needs	in	timely	manner	which	can	be	summarized	by	keywords	awareness	alertness	change
if	able	to	do	these	things	success	is	not	far	away

in	time	of	disruption	in	which	waves	of	change	are	pouring	heavily
every	sector	is	affected	without	exception
familiar	trade	fields	and	business	battlegrounds	are	changing	with	advanced	technology
until	the	day	when	large	businesses	must	face	competitors	that	are	new	start	ups
it	is	considered	opportunity	and	challenge	which	is	full	of	random	risks
but	it	is	necessary	to	move	forward	in	the	development	of	learning	in	an	age	that	the	world	is	fast	moving	forward

see	that	the	important	thing	in	doing	business	today	is	sense	of	urgency	we	must	ask	ourselves	all	the	time	like	people	like	to	ask	for	curve	or	business	growth
looking	for	new	business	model	to	the	question	in	advance	about	when	our	business	will	die	who	are	the	direct	competitors	indirect	competitor	and	what	will	happen	next	in	the	worst	case
in	each	section	of	the	business	we	must	keep	checking	to	not	be	in	the	comfort	zone	too	much
for	example	the	competitors	of	the	bank	maybe	not	just	the	bank	but	is	technology	organization	that	has	large	customer	database	to	compete	in	this	business	in	the	future
business	competitors	in	the	future	will	all	be	blurred
everyone	must	be	very	alert
some	businesses	such	as	grab	are	about	to	start	lending	money

the	following	will	see	more	connected	collaborations
for	example	banks	that	want	to	do	loans	in	the	digital	age	but	not	have	enough	information	must	rely	on	companies	that	have	enough	information	to	search	for	online	transaction	history

that	is	the	typical	orders	day	jumped	to	almost	orders	every	day
to	catch	up	with	that	demand	the	app	needed	to	urgently	increase	the	number	of	riders	by	some	and	provide	them	with	daily	online	rider	training	sessions

do	not	be	alarmed	if	there	are	lesser	voices	of	chinese	but	more	voices	of	indians	in	tourist	attractions
this	is	because	while	chinese	tourists	take	break	from	traveling	overseas	the	indian	market	is	thriving	and	becoming	another	flourishing	market	for	those	early	birds	to	extend	their	breath	in	time

for	those	businesses	that	have	never	been	in	contact	with	indians	before	you	might	question	where	to	start
of	course	the	first	point	would	be	to	know	customers	tastes	and	traveling	behavior
let	us	begin	with	the	types	of	traveling	which	there	are	interesting	groups	that	we	should	look	into	in	order	to	meet	the	demand	of	the	target	groups
the	first	type	would	be	group	traveling	in	both	tourist	companies	and	foreign	independent	tour	fit
especially	family	trip	is	one	of	the	largest	groups	in	the	indian	market	as	their	social	structure	is	family	based	and	family	members	are	tightly	knitted	to	one	another
there	is	study	that	married	couples	who	stay	with	their	partners	and	children	made	up	to	for	single	individuals	who	stay	with	their	parents	and	for	lovers	who	stay	together
therefore	to	target	the	market	of	families	with	children	or	parents	to	travel	together	or	match	lovers	and	honeymoon	there	will	be	an	opportunity	to	get	to	these	targets	easily
also	there	should	be	services	that	will	meet	the	demands	of	people	of	all	genders	and	ages
they	should	understand	young	people	by	introducing	program	that	will	bring	about	the	adventurous	experience	but	knows	the	behaviors	of	the	elderly	by	offering	relaxing	services	that	match	their	age	groups	as	well	as	preparing	recreational	activities	for	children
the	second	type	of	travelers	is	seminar	group	and	traveling	as	reward	group	or	those	office	workers	who	visit	foreign	countries	in	form	of	organizational	activities
they	are	considered	as	the	targets	that	are	directly	proportional	to	the	start	up	business	in	india	which	is	not	losing	to	the	growth	of	that	in	china	or	the	united	states	of	america
it	gains	more	than	million	us	dollars	foreign	investment	about	hundred	thousand	baht
when	there	is	high	business	competition	rewarding	employees	with	overseas	trips	or	business	trips	is	essential
however	to	present	the	travel	plan	that	hits	right	in	the	heart	of	the	target	group	consideration	of	the	budget	of	each	company	will	have	to	be	taken
as	for	the	behavior	in	booking	activities	despite	offline	travel	agencies	still	victors	the	growth	of	online	travel	agent	ota	should	not	be	overlooked
for	example	make	my	trip	an	ota	developed	in	india	and	holds	market	share	of
also	there	are	other	otas	that	put	up	their	competition	in	the	market	such	as	yatra	and	expedia

thus	online	platforms	serve	as	important	roles	for	information	to	be	widely	accessible	for	people	and	this	brings	about	the	decision	of	places	to	visit	and	serves	as	channels	to	relay	impressions	and	feedback	to	friends
this	easily	allows	the	needs	to	travel	to	continuously	happen	in	new	groups	of	traveler	thus	online	platforms	serve	as	important	roles	for	information	to	be	widely	accessible	for	people	and	this	brings	about	the	decision	of	places	to	visit	and	serves	as	channels	to	relay	impressions	and	feedbacks	to	friends
this	easily	allows	the	needs	to	travel	to	continuously	happen	in	new	groups	of	traveller	dietary	is	also	another	crucial	factor
service	providers	have	to	take	precautions	as	most	indians	are	vegetarians	and	even	though	indians	are	open	minded	about	different	food	cultures	they	would	want	to	have	taste	of	their	own	food	when	they	are	abroad	for	too	long
this	is	similar	to	the	thai	people	when	they	are	overseas
thai	need	taste	of	jasmine	rice	chili	paste	and	chicken	basil	as	well
all	this	time	thai	entrepreneurs	might	not	want	to	open	for	the	indian	market	because	they	are	not	ready	for	the	new	challenges
however	every	market	has	its	own	hurdles	to	overcome	before	reaching	the	finishing	line	full	of	opportunity
just	put	yourselves	in	their	shoes	and	you	will	capture	their	hearts
for	sme
in	the	digital	economy	era	technology	has	become	an	important	driving	force	of	the	economy
the	emergence	of	tech	company	founded	by	new	entrepreneurs	is	an	important	extension	to	strengthen	the	business
because	it	cannot	be	denied	that	in	today	business	world	technology	has	become	key	factor	affecting	the	competitiveness	of	players	in	the	market
scb	therefore	collaborated	with	nia	to	organize	the	nia	scb	innovation	based	enterprise	ibe	training	course	creating	opportunities	for	tech	company	groups	to	meet	with	smes	in	order	to	learn	insight	from	sme	and	sme	business	to	learn	technology	to	further	build
strong	business	partner
at	the	nia	scb	innovation	based	enterprise	ibe	preview	day	there	was	discussion	on	shift	business	with	right	partner	by	experts	in	the	tech	business	industry	including	khun	pariwat	wongsamran	director	of	startup	thailand	national	innovation	agency	public	organization	khun	rangsan	promprasit	ceo	queq	thailand	company	limited	khun	korlab	suwatcharungkul	chief	marketing	officer	at	get	and	khun	pailin	vichakul	cvc	team	digital	ventures
came	to	share	views	about	tech	company	in	thailand
tech	company	the	rising	star	of	the	thai	economy	during	the	past	years	the	tech	company	has	grown	very	far
the	company	that	has	been	around	for	about	one	year	has	new	features	and	has	expanded	the	market
expanding	domestic	and	international	customer	groups	including	many	new	tech	companies
however	tech	has	become	way	of	survival	for	many
businesses	that	need	to	adapt	technology	to	stay	in	the	market
however	tech	has	become	way	of	survival	for	many
businesses	that	need	to	adapt	technology	to	stay	in	the	market
if	technology	is	not	applied	or	does	not	cooperate	with	the	technology	company	it	may	not	be	able	to	catch	up	with	competitors	because	technology	has	become	part	of	everyday	life
soon	companies	will	not	be	ordinary	companies	but	will	become	tech	company	both	in	terms	of	being	technology	maker	and	being	technology	user
because	without	the	use	of	technology	the	operating	costs	are	so	high	that	it	cannot	compete
therefore	starting	business	must	first	think	about	how	to	use	technology
in	terms	of	investment	investments	in	the	tech	company	flow	in	quite	lot
seen	by	many	companies	in	almost	every	industry
including	financial	communication	conglomerate	group	etc	has	established	cvc	corporate	venture	capital	for	investment	in	the	tech	company
therefore	is	good	opportunity	for	tech	company	to	access	the	funding	source
however	despite	the	enormous	investment	funds	there	is	challenge	to	whether	company	that	invents	technology	that	is	good	enough	to	receive	investment	money	or	not
or	if	the	investment	has	been	received	will	it	be	able	to	group	the	customer	market
which	is	very	important	because	despite	the	funds	but	is	unable	to	group	the	customer	market	funding	will	continue	to	be	spent
tech	company	cannot	truly	grow
until	entering	the	zombie	state	which	is	very	important	because	despite	the	funds	but	is	unable	to	group	the	customer	market	funding	will	continue	to	be	spent
tech	company	cannot	truly	grow
until	entering	the	zombie	state	partnership	is	key	to	growth
zombies	is	tech	company	that	is	hard	to	grow
at	the	same	time	it	did	not	even	have	to	close	completely
and	the	tech	company	can	get	out	of	this	situation	is	to	find	business	partners	because	business	partners	are	an	important	part	of	the	company	to	grow	growth
both	in	terms	of	revenue	market	share	number	of	customers	the	cost	is	lower
partnership	with	related	businesses	can	also	help	solve	problems	in	the	value	chain	in	the	industry
the	business	partners	do	not	have	to	be	the	private	sector	alone	they	can	be	government	agencies	independent	agencies
in	the	tech	company	industry	speed	is	an	important	factor	in	competition
the	fastest	way	to	fix	weaknesses	is	to	find	business	partners
including	expanding	the	market	to	foreign	countries	that	we	do	not	have	expertise	in	the	area
therefore	finding	business	partner	is	important	to	tech	company	in	every	state
the	nia	scb	innovation	based	enterprise	ibe	course	is	organized	to	create	opportunities	for	tech	company	to	meet	with	partners	to	take	another	step
especially	for	sme	customers	who	need	technology	to	use	in	their	business
tech	company	is	already	technology	solution	producer	in	this	area
therefore	is	very	perfect	match
khun	korlab	suwatcharungkul	chief	marketing	officer	at	get	see	that	finding	business	partner	does	not	just	mean	buying	or	increasing	the	economy	of	scale
but	also	means	helping	each	other	to	develop	new	product	ideas	in	order	to	respond	to	create	happiness	for	customers
for	example	in	the	case	of	get	and	scb	there	is	an	instant	payout	system	that	takes	money	into	the	delivery	man	account	once	the	delivery	is	done
do	not	wait	on	weekly	basis
and	as	for	get	we	use	alliances	to	expand	into	other	regional	markets	is	way	to	really	adapt	the	local	business	model
from	the	perspective	of	investors	khun	pailin	vichakul	cvc	team	digital	ventures	speaking	of	what	investors	are	looking	for	in	tech	company	is	company	that	knows	its	weaknesses	and	strengths	and	know	how	to	supplement	your	own	business
win	win	is	the	cornerstone	of	the	partnership
what	are	the	important	things	about	doing	partnership
everyone	in	the	seminar	agrees	that	successful	partnership	is	necessary
khun	pariwat	wongsamran	director	of	startup	thailand	national	innovation	agency	public	organization	said	that	the	important	thing	in	making	an	affiliate	is	know	yourself	who	you	are
the	company	itself	is	in	which	state
what	are	your	own	products
who	are	you
who	are	you
know	your	own	limitations
what	can	be	done	and	cannot	be	done	and	win	win	partnership
what	will	we	give	him	and	what	does	he	give	you
partners	are	people	who	can	help	us	with	things	we	can	do
people	who	can	create	value	together
the	partnership	is	to	share	goal	share	value	of	both	parties
see	if	you	can	deliver	what	you	want
another	thing	to	think	about	is	how	much	both	parties	have	in	the	partnership
if	things	fail	will	they	be	accepted
some	people	may	look	at	this	as	waste	of	money	but	this	is	an	investment	because	in	every	failure	we	will	get	knowledge	and	experience	back
ibe	course	prepares	for	the	important	step	of	thai	tech	company	even	going	through	the	hardest	point	is	shaping	the	business	from	the	outset
but	stepping	forward	in	the	business	arena	is	still	challenge	that	the	tech	company	faces
the	ibe	innovation	based	enterprise	course	organized	by	nia	and	scb	aims	to	support	tech	company	entrepreneurs	preparing	for	strong	growth
which	is	week	long	course	starting	from	october	to	march	during	the	first	months	it	will	be	armed	with	organizational	management	knowledge	such	as	business	management	marketing	branding	finance	etc
and	in	the	last	months	an	important	part	that	will	help	push	towards	the	growth	stage	is	business	matching	with	sme	customers	of	the	bank
there	are	testing	ground	and	finding	business	alliances
lead	to	the	business	expansion	to	continue	to	compete	with	the	full	potential	in	attending	this	course	entrepreneurs	will	learn	to	do	the	right	partnership
is	to	create	networking	opportunity	for	the	business	to	meet	with	the	first	customer	or	partner	because	the	people	around	and	growing	together	will	be	the	best	partnership
as	for	the	speakers	and	coaches	of	this	program	they	are	the	top	gurus	in	business	circles	and	technology	of	the	country

over	the	past	two	years	the	healthy	trend	has	been	very	popular	and	is	likely	to	grow	by	more	than	worldwide
the	interesting	thing	about	this	trend	is	future	food	trends	futurefood	means	food	that	does	not	use	chemicals	in	production
future	food	will	change	the	export	industry	to	increase	the	value	in	the	era	which	will	result	in	the	changing	product	model	and	have	promoted	the	development	of	the	industry	into	the	market	more
one	factor	that	makes	future	food	important	to	the	food	industry	because	it	is	food	that	is	vital	to	the	body	and	safe	for	consumption
future	food	is	divided	into	groups	organic	food	is	products	derived	from	agricultural	products	that	are	safe	from	chemicals	novel	food	is	new	type	of	food	that	is	very	innovative
it	is	food	that	uses	new	production	process	and	never	produced	before	or	as	food	from	plants	or	animals
functional	food	is	product	that	is	not	medicine	or	supplement
it	is	food	designed	for	the	treatment	of	patients	with	specific	diseases	or	those	who	are	unable	to	eat	normal	food
medical	food	is	product	that	can	act	as	nutritional	value	for	the	body
fast	and	convenient
receive	funds	immediately
reduce	the	hassles	of	preparing	export	documents
increase	your	business	agility
the	challenge	of	leaders	in	this	era	is	to	manage	rapid	changes	that	never	happen	before	such	as	economic	situation	society	technology	natural	disaster	and	pandemic
leaders	with	vision	will	be	able	to	cope	with	changes	and	see	opportunities	in	the	midst	of	uncertainty	its	like	gps	leading	an	organization	to	the	right	direction
what	type	of	mindset	and	qualification	that	organizational	leaders	should	have	in	order	to	overcome	the	new	changing	world
the	nia	scb	innovation	based	enterprise	ibe	iii	disruptive	business	innovation	is	the	project	that	nia	academy	national	innovation	agency	cooperates	with	scb	to	arrange	for	smes	through	project	based	learning	conducted	by	khun	apiwut	managing	director	slingshot	group	thailand
sweet	spot	the	secret	code	of	success	khun	apiwut	states	that	the	key	element	of	success	consists	of	factors
mindset	is	set	of	thoughts	beliefs	and	attitudes	of	an	individual
skill	set	is	skill	that	person	needed	or	has	developed	to	accomplish	task	or	given	function	in	order	to	achieve	goal	or	success
tool	set	is	technology	that	helps	speed	up	an	individual	or	business	to	be	successful	faster
success	derives	from	the	intersection	of	above	mentioned	factors	and	then	becomes	sweet	spot
thus	if	we	want	ourselves	and	our	business	to	accomplish	we	should	look	back	to	check	our	mindset	whether	we	have	enough	mindset	or	how	tool	or	technology	can	support	us
in	training	course	khun	apiwut	talks	specifically	about	mindset	through	case	study	and	the	attendants	analyze	and	share	their	thoughts
theres	no	ultimate	formula	in	running	the	business	therefore	there	should	be	some	ways	to	study	and	apply	to	the	business	that	were	doing
as	the	global	context	changes	things	will	never	be	the	same
operating	the	business	or	working	nowadays	are	tremendously	different	from	the	last	years
say	goodbye	to	routine	job	and	enter	gig	workforce	the	future	company	wont	need	to	own	permanent	employees	its	status	is	to	be	temporary	owner	employer	which	is	called	gig	workforce
khun	apiwut	shares	an	example	that	the	employers	in	the	past	are	not	pleased	when	employees	resigned	or	took	some	part	time	jobs	because	they	wanted	to	own	lifelong	employees
anyway	things	have	changed	over	time
today	the	new	generation	no	longer	wants	to	stick	with	full	time	job	permanently	but	enjoys	taking	second	or	third	job	at	the	same	time
consequently	some	companies	may	hire	their	employees	for	days	and	employees	can	spend	another	days	working	on	anything	they	like
new	generations	want	to	have	their	own	business	such	as	startup	youtuber	online	seller	but	still	need	stable	income	and	have	time	to	do	other	job
they	mostly	enter	gig	workplace	which	is	different	from	freelance
gig	workforce	is	more	than	freelance	as	its	not	just	to	finish	one	piece	of	job	and	leave
gig	workplace	is	similar	to	full	time	job	as	employees	will	be	continually	hired	but	employers	allow	them	to	find	and	work	on	some	other	jobs
gig	workforce	is	more	prevalent	now	so	entrepreneurs	have	to	understand	how	the	world	has	changed	what	is	the	attitude	of	new	generation	and	what	are	new	hiring	trends
what	is	the	difference	between	change	vs	transformation
we	are	now	hearing	the	word	transformation	more	often
how	is	it	different	from	change
khun	apiwut	states	that	change	is	to	make	something	different	but	in	the	old	world	such	as	the	bank	shifts	service	at	its	branches	to	service	through	mobile	banking
that	means	the	bank	still	provides	the	same	service	but	only	the	channel	is	changed
while	transformation	is	to	change	the	pattern	of	organization	such	as	scb	is	the	transformation	of	bank	pattern	to	parent	company	but	it	still	serves	the	old	business	that	is	to	be	the	intermediary	bank
however	scb	subsidiary	company	is	not	transformation	but	its	the	upper	level	called	game	changer	which	its	pattern	method	thoughts	are	changed
for	instance	there	were	separate	devices	like	camera	video	camera	and	ipod	in	the	old	days	while	now	the	iphone	collaborates	all	phone	functions	in	one	mobile	phone
thats	game	changer
besides	mobile	phones	in	the	past	got	their	features	from	the	manufacturers	while	iphone	offers	app	store	allowing	users	to	change	its	features	more	than	just	mobile	phone
thats	also	game	changer
another	example	is	tutorial	school	which	its	business	model	is	to	selling	content
if	we	shift	offline	teaching	to	online	its	change	because	we	still	sell	content	but	only	the	channel	is	changed
or	if	the	content	is	changed	for	sale	or	take	job	as	content	design	that	will	be	transformation	because	the	service	is	changed	but	the	same	business	model	is	used
unlike	khan	academy	an	online	tutorial	school	that	produces	content	but	not	for	sale
the	school	changes	new	business	model	and	makes	money	from	subscription	and	advertising
thats	called	game	changer	as	playing	method	and	process	are	changed
therefore	when	talking	about	disruption	it	doesnt	happen	from	change	or	transform	of	competitors	or	other	company	but	from	game	changers	new	business	model
thus	concern	is	to	realize	whether	our	business	has	game	changer	or	new	business	model	which	can	change	ways	to	making	money
apart	from	change	and	transform	entrepreneurs	may	need	to	seek	chance	to	be	game	changer
even	though	its	hard	to	do	so	but	if	you	can	do	it	youll	become	game	controller	and	dont	have	to	fight	anymore
case	study	the	business	operation	of	forever	vs	reformation	forever	the	business	is	started	from	south	korean	couple	who	migrated	to	the	at	first	they	made	living	by	doing	labor	work	and	then	noticed	that	the	rich	mostly	owned	clothing	business
later	they	invested	in	clothing	business	imported	from	korea	called	fashion	at	los	angeles	california
in	the	brand	name	was	changed	to	forever	and	experienced	tremendous	growth	over	the	first	years	with	an	expansion	to	branches
the	key	success	was	branch	expansion	large	space	cheap	price	fast	fashion	style	and	plenty	of	staff
sales	hit	us	billion	in	branch	available	in	square	feet	in	business	expansion	overseas	in	and	due	to	emerging	of	online	business	at	that	time	the	company	added	online	channel	but	kept	expanding	branches	and	stocked	many	products
in	branches	were	reduced	and	all	branches	worldwide	were	closed	down
the	business	finally	declared	bankruptcy	in	reformation	the	business	is	founded	by	yael	aflalo	woman	whose	passion	is	to	operate	sustainable	fashion	business
when	visiting	china	she	experienced	that	part	of	manufacturing	process	in	textile	business	destroyed	environment	so	she	saw	an	opportunity	to	create	new	positioning	of	environmental	fashion	business
besides	most	top	fashion	brands	share	similar	concept	large	shop	all	colors	and	sizes	are	available	numerous	branches	separate	online	and	offline	channels
on	the	other	hand	reformation	thinks	differently
the	business	doesnt	focus	on	size	and	number	of	branches	clothes	not	available	in	all	colors	and	sizes	creating	user	experience	by	technology	using	online	along	with	offline	to	solve	buyer	pain	points
online	buyers	cant	touch	real	clothes	or	try	on	them	while	offline	buyers	have	to	travel	to	the	shops
for	example	customers	who	enter	the	shop	will	see	some	size	of	clothes	cutting	and	cloth	texture
and	then	they	can	pick	the	clothes	online	from	large	monitor	in	the	shop
once	customers	click	the	products	the	shop	will	arrange	fitting	room	with	selected	clothes	hanging	in	there
the	fitting	room	will	be	exclusively	provided	in	large	room	equipped	with	plenty	options	of	music	the	room	light	can	be	adjusted	to	both	day	and	night	tone	to	suit	customer	occasion
if	customers	are	not	pleased	with	trial	clothes	they	can	make	new	choice	online
staff	will	hang	new	clothes	in	the	wardrobe	which	doors	can	be	opened	in	both	sides
one	side	is	for	staff	to	hang	the	clothes	for	customers	and	the	other	for	customers	to	take	the	clothes	and	try	on
the	wardrobe	is	operated	by	open	closed	innovation	so	that	its	doors	never	open	at	the	same	time
once	the	order	is	made	customers	can	make	online	payment	right	away	without	seeing	the	staff
the	concept	to	think	outside	the	box	enhances	customers	to	experience	the	feeling	of	online	together	with	offline	purchasing
as	result	sales	have	grown	exponentially	and	the	brand	quickly	gains	high	popularity	in	the	khun	apiwut	says	that	reformation	has	changed	the	way	of	thinking	service	pattern	and	game	playing
its	wise	that	entrepreneurs	in	fashion	business	keep	an	eye	on	reformation	whether	theyll	become	game	changer	in	the	future	market
referring	to	the	case	study	of	forever	vs	reformation	its	founded	that	traditional	success	may	not	guarantee	further	success	anymore
lets	see	how	the	following	factors	can	help	you	attain	business	accomplishment
strategy	strategies	goals	and	methods	to	achieve	success	leaders	organizational	leaders	culture	organizational	culture
theres	saying	that	culture	eat	strategy	for	breakfast
no	matter	how	well	you	plan	but	the	organizational	culture	thought	process	and	organizational	beliefs	are	not	harmonized	with	the	business	strategies	theres	rare	opportunity	for	those	strategies	to	bring	success
sat	leader	vs	act	leader	sat	leader	is	traditional	leader	who	uses	strategies	to	manage	the	business	focusing	on	growth	such	as	sales	volume	organizational	size	number	of	branches	etc
this	type	of	leader	is	likely	to	exercise	authority	over	subordinates	when	making	decisions
the	organizational	culture	is	an	individual	works	independently	employees	tend	to	have	repulsive	characters	and	employees	feel	attached	to	the	same	success	toxic
act	leader	is	contemporary	leader	who	uses	combination	strategy
the	leader	will	communicate	explain	about	goals	and	strategies	to	employees	so	everyone	will	see	the	same	picture	articulate	and	focus	on	cooperation	or	business	partner	connect	because	its	better	to	succeed	as	team	than	individual
the	organizational	culture	is	need	to	build	reliability	working	trustworthy	and	the	leader	should	empower	employees	to	solve	problems	or	make	decisions
characteristics	of	great	leader	uncharted	explorer	an	explorer	who	is	bold	to	be	game	changer	always	love	thinking	doing	and	trying	new	things
success	warrior	warrior	who	stays	hungry	for	success	and	puts	hard	effort	to	achieve	goal
empathic	communicator	communicator	who	wants	others	to	understand	goal	setting
synergetic	winner	team	builder
the	leader	cant	work	alone	and	will	need	teamwork	to	strive	for	success
diversity	promoter	multi	purpose	managing	person	who	believes	that	good	teamwork	should	consist	of	wide	variety	of	skills	otherwise	the	team	will	fail
torch	bearer	person	who	is	able	to	pass	on	success	from	one	generation	to	the	next
to	achieve	success	the	leaders	in	this	era	must	change	from	being	sat	leader	to	act	leader	as	the	world	nowadays	has	changed	rapidly
here	is	the	mindset	summary	that	new	gen	leaders	must	possess	well	rounded	fast	paced	vision	new	strategy	thinker	effective	communicator	demonstrating	goal	to	all	employees	for	common	understanding	empowering	employees	to	solve	problems	and	make	decisions	and	working	as	team	towards	company	success

vietnam	is	one	of	thailands	neighbors	which	has	been	successful	in	adapting	and	fighting	the	pandemic	since	the	first	stage	during	early	until	now
only	were	infected	in	vietnam	with	no	death	information	of	june	th
it	is	one	of	the	few	nations	that	are	able	to	control	the	disease
the	pandemic	strongly	affects	many	countries	whose	economic	growths	are	expected	to	be	low	to	negative	during	this	year	including	china	and	the	us
however	vietnams	first	quarter	gdp	grew	more	compared	to	the	same	time	last	year
it	is	one	of	few	nations	in	which	even	covid	negatively	impacts	the	economy	however	the	gdp	is	still	positive	though	it	is	the	least	in	years
the	most	affected	sector	in	vietnam	is	the	local	agricultural	sector	as	their	main	customers	are	china	whose	borders	have	been	closed	since	the	early	pandemic
fruits	that	used	to	be	tremendously	exported	such	as	dragon	fruit	durian	watermelon	are	oversupplied	and	underpriced
it	was	solved	by	promoting	domestic	consumption
many	business	and	restaurant	owners	creatively	process	those	fruits	for	example	abc	bakery	bakes	the	bread	with	the	ingredient	of	dragon	fruit	and	watermelon	duy	anh	foods	launched	watermelon	glass	noodle	and	roll	dough	and	meatball	from	dragon	fruit	lavifood	makes	dragon	fruit	juice	kfc	introduces	pink	bread	from	dragon	fruit
these	products	are	not	only	consumed	domestically	but	also	full	of	creativity	and	can	be	sold	internationally	at	higher	than	their	original	price
moreover	we	have	seen	the	adaptation	of	retailers	restaurants	and	fine	diners	as	they	are	increasing	their	online	sales
online	shopping	platforms	such	as	lazada	and	shopee	also	add	more	products	and	food	from	convenient	stores	and	supermarkets	to	promote	customers	convenience	during	the	lockdown
delivery	was	made	through	delivery	service	including	now	vn	grab	lalamove	baemin	and	soviet	which	promotes	the	sale	by	during	the	first	quarter	of	the	year
importantly	the	government	issues	the	relief	procedure	for	their	people	who	are	affected	by	the	covid
there	is	plenty	of	help	including	money	to	subsidize	individually	or	as	household
extending	the	tax	paying	and	rental	deadline	by	months	from	june	th	for	businesses
the	bank	of	vietnam	has	decreased	the	interest	rate	to	minimum	of
the	ministry	of	industry	and	trade	decreased	of	electric	bills	for	months	april	june
after	the	economic	disaster	overcome	the	government	plans	to	revive	the	economy	by	stimulating	encouraging	and	supporting	the	business	sectors
it	has	been	proposed	that	all	fees	shall	be	reduced	for	the	airline	businesses
the	tourism	promotion	plans	have	been	prepared
many	measures	have	been	issued	to	ensure	their	food	security
food	and	agricultural	processing	abilities	were	improved
the	disease	control	has	been	strictly	implemented	in	the	slaughterhouse
to	stabilize	the	pork	price	in	the	market	more	pork	has	been	imported	to	increase	the	production	capacity
the	ministry	of	finance	reduced	the	step	of	work	and	the	fees	to	reduce	the	operating	cost	of	the	business	owners
furthermore	the	government	has	monitored	the	report	with	the	related	organizations	to	help	the	business	runs	smoothly
the	utilization	of	the	investment	budget	has	been	expedited	especially	the	residue	from	and	the	planned	budget	for	to	stimulate	the	economy
it	can	be	seen	that	besides	the	vietnam	government	the	private	sector	also	plays	major	role	in	fighting	the	pandemic	and	not	letting	the	affected	one	fight	alone
this	reflects	their	unity	as	they	can	survive	the	situation	by	creating	new	products
these	together	drive	the	nations	economy	to	overcome	the	disaster
vietnam	will	become	strong	country	with	all	the	factors	suitable	for	investment	as	the	vietnamese	are	the	fighters	who	can	handle	the	problems	well

the	true	story	that	international	businesspeople	face	importers	of	products	do	not	have	to	waste	time	traveling	to	trade	fair	days	days	anymore	because	with	the	new	online	platform	scb	trade	club	provides	shortcut	way	for	importers	to	contact	trade	partners	every	day	anytime	anywhere	easily	and	safely	via	every	familiar	device
khun	kaniya	isariyapracha	from	vogue	living	limited	will	tell	us	about	the	ease	of	use	of	the	scb	trade	club	helping	to	find	both	import	and	export	partners	that	are	as	simple	as	using	general	applications
the	fun	of	importing	business	and	being	distributor	fun	and	interesting	should	come	from	the	flexibility	that	we	can	choose	from
bring	any	product	to	be	distributed	in	the	country	no	restrictions	on	production	capacity	or	the	matter	of	production	that	must	be	produced	specifically
because	we	are	distributors	we	saw	something	interesting
what	are	the	new	trends
or	seeing	the	opportunity	of	the	growth	of	any	type	of	product	we	can	select	that	product	and	then	import	it	to	sell	in	thailand
khun	jean	kaniya	isariyapracha	from	vogue	living	limited	importer	and	distributor	of	food	confectionery	kitchenware	for	over	years
tell	us	the	fun	of	being	an	importer	and	distributor
she	believes	that	flexibility	can	make	this	business	easier	to	create	as	business	opportunity	than	being	manufacturer
when	there	are	more	competitors	have	to	adjust	more	now	there	no	need	to	sell	at	the	mall
it	can	sell	online	and	able	to	sell	directly	to	the	customers	via	social	commerce	and	especially	nowadays	it	is	quite	open	for	new	players	to	get	into	the	market	lot	easier	than	before
khun	jean	describes	the	competition	in	business	where	competitors	are	entering	the	field	much	easier
unlike	in	the	olden	days	there	were	language	restrictions	communication	traveling	to	meet	partners
as	well	as	having	high	level	of	capital	but	now	with	technology	easier	travel	it	encourages	new	competitors	come	into	this	business	more	easily	with	more	competitors	what	are	the	advantages	or	potential	that	vogue	living	can	maintain	its	strength	in	the	market
khun	jean	seen	is	long	experience	that	makes	it	easy	to	see	which	product	is	selling	or	not	selling	and	which	products	are	suitable	for	our	home	market	and	will	be	accepted
imported	and	will	not	lose
while	new	competitors	when	the	product	is	sold	but	may	not	be	able	to	successfully	market	that	product	for	the	long	term
in	which	these	matters	require	experience	together	with	having	good	relationship	with	every	partner	channel	whether	shopping	malls	or	various	stores	which	have	good	relationships	that	can	help	in	negotiating	the	cost	to	be	cheaper	than	the	new	entrants
when	the	lifestyle	of	the	consumers	has	changed	the	business	has	to	change	accordingly	in	the	past	going	back	years	or	years	ago	the	product	life	cycle	of	almost	every	product	is	long
we	brought	in	one	product
it	can	be	sold	with	us	for	years
khun	jean	talks	about	doing	business	in	the	olden	days
she	goes	on	to	say	that	today	many	of	the	company	product	portfolios	are	still	years	years	old	but	more	and	more	products	have	shorter	life	cycles
this	is	in	line	with	the	behavior	of	consumers	today	who	like	to	experiment	with	new	things	all	the	time	constantly	changing	get	bored	easily
therefore	entrepreneurs	need	to	create	excitement	for	consumers
suppose	if	it	is	an	original	brand	then	we	have	to	bring	in	new	flavors	for	example	the	candies	we	make	have	to	be	flavored	with	milk	tea	like	that	in	order	to	respond	to	the	current	trend	said	khun	jean
which	if	existing	brands	do	not	have	new	product	development	then	they	must	find	new	types	of	products	or	maybe	in	the	same	category	but	with	new	flavors	new	packaging	to	create	excitement	or	increase	sales	to	replace	the	lost	sales	of	the	old	one
being	replaced	by	competitors	or	changing	consumer	behavior	today	new	ways	to	easily	find	new	products	and	contact	partners	khun	jean	said	that	if	in	the	olden	days	the	traditional	method	was	to	go	to	trade	fairs	in	foreign	countries	around	the	world
and	see	the	products	that	open	booth
if	interested	go	to	negotiate	business	talk	about	the	price	and	various	conditions
the	process	takes	about	days
khun	jean	went	on	to	say	that	once	he	went	to	trade	fair	she	didn	dare	to	ask	rather	sensitive	question	like	sales	subject	expertise	of	partners
as	young	woman	and	for	the	first	time	having	to	talk	to	more	mature	partner	makes	her	unable	to	ask	and	the	other	person	does	not	answer	directly
which	is	another	problem	encountered	when	going	to	trade	fairs	the	next	method	is	little	easier	if	traveling	to	supermarket	overseas
if	you	see	product	that	is	currently	not	being	sold	in	our	market	and	interested	then	email	to	ask	or	sometimes	call	to	ask
after	talking	to	certain	extent	they	will	fly	to	see	the	factory
see	if	he	really	exists
does	the	factory	meet	all	the	documentation	standards	that	thailand	needs	to	import
which	is	still	traditional
now	it	easier	to	have	scb	trade	club	that	helps	us	find	partners	whether	import	or	export
for	us	the	import	is	the	main
the	trade	club	helps	us	lot
by	choosing	from	products	that	interest	us	or	the	market	that	we	are	interested	in	we	may	have	to	go	to	the	destination	country	first	and	then	select	the	product	group	you	can	see	list	of	many	manufacturers
we	can	see	how	large	his	organization	is
how	much	are	his	sales
aside	from	being	manufacturer	are	you	also	trader
there	is	background	for	us	to	study
we	were	able	to	get	to	know	new	brand	or	new	factory	from	the	scb	trade	club
khun	jean	told	us	about	new	online	channel	that	helps	us	to	search	for	new	products	and	new	partners	easily	conveniently	and	with	complete	information	in	one	place
scb	trade	clubis	not	only	useful	for	importers	vogue	living	itself	even	now	import	is	the	key	business	but	began	to	have	ideas	to	export	as	well
khun	jean	considers	the	scb	trade	club	to	help	open	the	door	to	study	the	export	market	which	countries	need	products	that	the	company	has	or	is	distributor	or	not
even	oems	are	manufactured	under	their	own	brands	and	exported
this	platform	makes	it	easier	to	open	the	export	market
khun	jean	told	us	that	there	was	case	contacted	via	email	saying	he	saw	the	company	products	and	wanted	to	sell	them	in	malaysia
khun	jean	cannot	know	whether	the	contact	person	is	trustworthy	or	not	or	have	good	credit
meaning	not	knowing	any	background	of	that	company
she	said	that	the	background	information	about	trading	partners	available	in	the	scb	trade	club	can	be	used	to	filter	partners	to	certain	extent	and	gives	the	courage	to	start	business	with	new	partners	whether	importing	or	exporting
easy	to	use	function	no	different	from	the	application	in	the	past	had	to	walk	for	the	fair	for	days	days	but	now	can	do	it	every	day	every	time	can	chat
meaning	there	will	be	button	to	send	message
if	you	re	interested	we	can	talk	to	him	and	chat
like	chat	application
khun	jean	describes	the	ease	in	using	scb	trade	club	with	simple	functions
no	different	from	the	applications	that	we	are	familiar	with
which	having	the	chat	function	makes	it	easier	for	both	parties	to	talk	to	each	other	used	to	introduce	myself	about	each	side	who	is	doing	business	what	expertise	what	products	are	in	the	port
including	business	cards	of	each	company	in	the	system	as	well	make	both	sides	able	to	pre	screening	each	other
if	you	want	to	ask	in	more	detail	you	can	continue	chatting
we	see	that	it	helps	us	save	time	because	we	can	get	to	know	each	other	first
if	finished	if	he	goes	to	trade	fair	we	meet	the	real	person	then	we	can	continue	to	talk	and	then	close	the	deal
instead	of	having	to	sit	and	communicate	with	each	other	via	email
screening	for	reliable	partners	that	meet	standards	khun	jean	told	about	meeting	chinese	partner	at	trade	fair	in	guangdong
initially	everything	looks	like	standard	partner	because	of	having	booth	at	the	trade	fair	and	including	has	all	the	certificates	that	the	fda	needs
talked	to	the	stage	of	registration	of	the	import	of	goods	has	been	completed	and	can	import	now
so	will	go	to	see	the	real	factory	in	china
when	arriving	at	the	factory	she	is	shocked	because	the	factory	manager	is	wearing	slippers	clothes	look	unclean	and	lacking	standards
each	employee	wears	cloth	like	stay	at	home	but	works	in	the	factory
machinery	is	not	clean	rusty	or	dirty	cobweb	environment
these	things	cannot	be	seen	at	all	in	the	product
finally	having	to	cancel	the	deal	because	cannot	be	able	to	bring	products	from	this	factory	to	sell	to	thai	people
which	wastes	both	time	and	money	to	fly	to	see	the	factory
scb	trade	clubhas	filtered	the	standards	of	the	entrepreneurs	to	certain	extent
because	regardless	of	which	entrepreneurs	are	members	they	must	be	selected	by	the	bank	therefore	the	financial	situation	must	be	stable	to	certain	extent
khun	jean	added
when	the	world	changes	consumer	behavior	has	changed	technology	has	opened	the	world	for	easier	communication	and	doing	business	for	both	importers	and	exporters
the	scb	trade	club	platform	can	be	used	to	search	for	partners	in	each	country	and	industry	of	their	choice
including	the	study	of	statistical	data	about	documents	and	regulations
enabling	both	parties	to	know	the	background	of	each	other	whether	it	matches
which	helps	to	save	time	and	easily	negotiate	to	talk	in	single	channel	no	different	from	applications	that	are	familiar	to	us	in	general	functional	complete	and	modern	like	this	businessmen	who	see	an	opportunity	should	not	miss	business	customers	who	are	interested	in	becoming	part	of	the	global	business	network	scb	trade	club	can	request	the	business	relations	manager	or	scb	business	call	center	the	global	trade	platform	designed	to	help	your	business	expand	internationally

if	less	than	it	is	considered	niche	product
the	factors	that	people	choose	to	buy	with	the	seller	are	the	selling	price	of	each	store	the	number	of	stars	that	customers	give	review	stars	the	number	of	reviews	that	many	reviews	will	mean	the	number	of	people	coming	to	buy	lot
and	reviews	can	also	be	used	to	estimate	sales	because	according	to	statistics	of	buyers	will	return	to	review	the	product
in	addition	it	includes	badges	that	can	be	obtained	from	amazon	com	such	as	bestseller	amazon	choice	and	prime
although	the	website	amazon	com	already	has	information	displayed	but	going	to	explore	all	the	information	is	hundred	thousand	items	it	is	waste	of	time
an	important	function	of	tool	jungle	scout	is	to	help	analyze	the	product	potential	in	one	click
just	enter	the	name	of	the	product	item	that	you	want	to	sell
the	tool	will	sweep	all	that	product	information	and	analyze	average	monthly	sales	average	selling	price	sales	per	month	revenue	number	reviews	quality	reviews	of	each	owner
the	key	is	to	evaluate	whether	the	product	is	likely	to	be	sold	or	not
by	looking	at	the	needs	of	the	market	and	competition	and	analyze	it	into	score
if	the	product	you	are	aiming	for	scores	more	than	there	is	high	chance	of	success
although	the	use	of	jungle	scout	is	free	at	scb	which	is	partner	with	amazon	global	sellingthailand	entrepreneurs	who	join	the	amazon	jumpstart	program	can	try	jungle	scout	with	scb	to	explore	the	potential	of	products	in	the	american	online	market	with	no	charge
want	to	send	products	to	sell	now	right
do	not	wait	and	get	to	know	the	next	tool	to	support	the	sellers
create	reliable	product	reviews	using	early	reviewer	program	when	choosing	product	to	sell	and	have	an	account	opened	selling	your	own	products	have	beautiful	photos	complete	product	details	that	concise	not	be	hasty
the	important	thing	that	makes	our	listing	reliable	and	customers	decide	to	buy	from	us	is	product	review
both	in	terms	of	quantity	and	quality
according	to	amazon	statistics	when	listing	has	or	more	reviews	the	sales	will	increase	significantly
therefore	the	seller	must	make	listing	of	reviews	as	soon	as	possible
here	amazon	com	also	has	the	early	reviewer	program	program	to	support	sellers
which	will	send	promotions	to	buy	discounts	on	anything	on	amazon	com	for	customers	who	return	product	reviews
the	promotion	that	amazon	com	provides	will	help	attract	online	shoppers	to	return	product	reviews	effectively	strategy	to	grab	customers	with	giveaway	samples	through	amazon	giveaway	usually	if	it	is	store	that	has	general	storefront	the	distribution	of	trial	products	is	one	of	the	promotions	that	are	usually	done	to	get	customers
this	strategy	can	be	done	with	online	marketing
it	is	seeding	technique	that	helps	to	increase	ranking	results	search	results	products	on	the	first	page
with	amazon	com	having	the	amazon	giveaway	program	by	giving	away	free	product	samples	to	interested	customers	by	filling	in	the	address	information
in	which	the	seller	can	specify	the	distribution	ratio	of	the	product	samples	such	as	giveaway	or	giveaway	etc
this	strategy	in	addition	to	helping	with	trial	and	product	visibility	we	also	obtain	information	about	customers	who	are	interested	in	our	products
in	order	to	do	promotions	invite	to	buy	again	and	there	are	also	opportunities	for	customers	to	come	back	to	review	and	build	credibility	for	our	products	as	well
calculate	the	cost	of	fba	service	fees	first	let	explain	the	fba	system	again
the	fba	system	stands	for	fulfillment	by	amazon
is	logistics	system	that	helps	sme	entrepreneurs	to	sell	products	in	the	commerce	market	in	america	effectively
only	the	operator	sends	the	goods	to	the	amazon	com	warehouse	in	the	united	states
when	an	order	arrives	the	amazon	com	team	will	help	pack	the	product	to	the	customer
and	helps	with	customer	service	answering	questions	including	returning	or	exchanging	products
in	addition	to	facilitating	logistics	the	use	of	the	fba	system	also	makes	our	products	accessible	to	prime	member	members	who	pay	annual	membership	fees	and	receive	free	delivery	fees
over	customers	in	this	group	are	heavy	buyers	who	buy	lot	and	prime	member	customers	will	buy	products	with	prime	sign	first
and	the	acquisition	of	the	prime	mark	the	seller	must	use	the	fba	system	in	this	regard	sellers	using	the	fba	system	will	be	charged	for	this	service	with	amazon	com	dividing	the	costs	into	parts	sellers	who	want	to	know	fba	service	costs	for	cost	calculation	can	check	the	costs	through	using	asin	numbers	of	products	that	are	similar	or	close	to	the	products	that	we	want	to	sell	will	be	able	to	moderate	the	cost	of	fba	services
aside	from	these	tool	programs	there	are	also	various	strategies	to	help	sme	entrepreneurs	deliver	their	products	to	online	marketing	on	amazon	com

boten	is	city	in	luang	namtha	on	the	lao	chinese	border	opposite	the	autonomous	prefecture	of	xishuangbanna	in	the	southwestern	chinese	province	of	yunnan	bordering	myanmar	and	laos
boten	has	recently	begun	to	regain	its	former	prominence	as	significant	business	hub	in	laos
this	commercial	metropolis	originally	prospered	as	city	for	chinese	entertainment	with	buildings	owned	by	chinese	investors	to	house	casinos	that	are	illegal	in	china
due	to	the	ban	casino	operators	sought	to	conduct	business	in	neighboring	countries
boten	has	been	one	of	the	most	sought	after	areas	due	to	its	proximity	to	yunnan	province	in	the	southern	part	of	china
in	boten	entered	prosperous	period
the	original	extensive	paddy	fields	were	turned	into	magnificent	landscape	of	well	constructed	tall	buildings	housing	hotels	casinos	entertainment	venues	restaurants	and	retail	stores
the	economy	was	thriving	with	many	chinese	tourists	arriving	every	day
since	casinos	are	banned	in	china	chinese	gamblers	had	to	cross	the	border	to	boten
two	years	later	there	was	an	incident	in	which	casino	operators	detained	chinese	gamblers	who	were	unable	to	pay	their	debts	prompting	the	chinese	government	to	impose	stricter	requirements	for	entry	into	laos
china	also	cut	off	electricity	to	boten	and	asked	laos	for	assistance	in	closing	down	casinos	in	boten
after	that	boten	became	an	abandoned	city	whose	economy	had	crumbled
in	the	lao	people	democratic	republic	officially	inaugurated	the	lao	china	railway	as	part	of	its	efforts	to	advance	the	country	economic	development
the	railroad	line	from	kunming	in	china	to	vientiane	is	intended	to	connect	thailand	malaysia	and	singapore
with	boten	being	the	first	stop	when	entering	laos	pdr	via	train	it	is	highly	anticipated	that	it	will	turn	into	transportation	hub
the	lao	government	has	granted	hong	kong	phuc	hong	travel	company	concession	to	create	special	economic	zone	sez	that	will	feature	factories	offices	duty	free	stores	international	bus	terminals	train	stations	and	golf	courses	thereby	increasing	boten	chances	of	recovery
realizing	the	promising	potential	to	improve	transportation	even	further	china	and	laos	held	meeting	in	june	to	sign	an	mou	for	an	expressway	project	which	entailed	constructing	an	expressway	parallel	to	the	lao	china	railway	connecting	bo	kaeo	and	boten	in	lao	pdr
currently	the	road	two	lane	road	that	traverses	rugged	terrain	serves	the	route
due	to	poor	road	conditions	it	might	take	transporters	up	to	five	hours	to	go	mere	kilometers
this	huai	sai	boten	expressway	will	reduce	travel	time	from	five	hours	to	just	ninety	minutes	and	its	elevated	structure	will	make	commuting	simpler	and	safer
both	the	laos	china	railway	and	the	huai	sai	boten	expressway	project	will	considerably	promote	the	economic	growth	of	boten
as	the	first	train	station	into	the	lao	pdr	boten	will	experience	resurgence	of	economic	vitality
when	the	huai	sai	boten	expressway	is	completed	boten	will	become	new	transportation	hub	and	special	economic	zone	stimulating	the	economy	with	industries	office	buildings	and	duty	free	stores
this	astonishing	development	will	benefit	not	only	china	and	the	lao	people	democratic	republic	but	thailand	as	well
china	primary	purpose	is	to	construct	an	economic	link	connecting	thailand	malaysia	and	singapore	via	the	lao	people	democratic	republic
thai	entrepreneurs	interested	in	trading	and	investing	in	lao	pdr	can	contact	the	siam	commercial	bank	vientiane	branch	for	advice	and	financial	support	for	increasing	the	flexibility	of	running	their	business

siam	commercial	bank	the	first	bank	in	thailand	has	been	pillar	of	the	thai	economy	for	over	years
the	bank	acknowledgment	of	data	as	corporate	treasure	is	sign	that	scb	is	ahead	of	the	competition
since	data	is	still	relatively	novel	idea	in	thailand	the	bank	is	among	the	first	organizations	to	establish	the	groundwork	for	data	and	technology
this	article	will	explain	how	thailand	oldest	bank	became	one	of	the	first	institutions	in	the	country	to	employ	cutting	edge	data	and	ai	technology
scb	implemented	enterprise	data	warehouse	edw	technologies	in	which	consolidate	all	data	into	single	repository
before	data	lake	repositories	became	thing	companies	used	terms	such	as	big	data	and	unstructured	data
data	lake	stores	data	to	facilitate	analytics	and	other	operations
this	big	database	can	store	both	unstructured	and	semi	structured	data
prior	to	the	advent	of	big	data	data	was	collected	and	structured	in	tabular	format	and	the	data	warehouse	team	was	responsible	for	creating	data	relational	models
in	when	this	small	team	was	first	formed	scb	began	collaborating	with	leading	consulting	firm	accenture	to	build	data	platform	with	accenture	being	responsible	for	the	initial	deployment
this	turnkey	project	took	year	to	complete	because	it	was	an	on	premises	data	lake	leveraging	the	then	popular	cloudera	data	platform	and	data	center	installed	servers
with	cloudera	scb	has	adopted	unique	strategy
typically	edw	receives	data	in	the	form	of	files	for	export	to	teradata	for	model	creation
however	scb	transmitted	files	directly	to	big	data	for	transformation	into	models	bypassing	edw
edw	provides	operational	downstream	and	application	support	for	the	data	lake	with	analytics	the	data	lake	primary	function
edw	and	data	lake	functions	were	divided	with	each	having	their	own
the	data	lake	is	mostly	utilized	by	analytics	teams	throughout	the	organization
in	the	past	teams	depended	on	the	centralized	edw	pool	as	their	major	data	source
all	edw	resources	were	centralized	and	could	not	be	scaled	up	making	it	sluggish	process	to	analyze	massive	amounts	of	data
the	data	lake	is	possible	alternative	to	edw	for	analytics	requiring	evaluation	of	long	term	historical	data
our	data	lake	was	created	to	enable	data	analytics	teams	to	evaluate	vast	amounts	of	historical	data	more	quickly
in	the	years	that	followed	more	users	began	to	utilize	the	data	lake
the	fia	team	was	among	the	first	users	to	submit	requests	for	financial	analysis	models	to	the	data	lake	team
since	then	the	program	user	base	has	continuously	increased
in	the	year	following	the	completion	of	the	data	lake	platform	in	the	bank	management	mandated	the	use	of	cloud	computing
upon	completion	of	this	project	the	data	team	was	divided	into	the	data	science	team	data	solution	delivery	team	data	engineer	team	data	operations	teams	and	data	visualize	teams	to	form	the	data	solution	support	team	dss
their	functions	were	split	based	on	the	architecture	of	the	data	lake	platform
these	teams	assist	the	analytics	teams	with	the	fia	team	among	the	initial	adopters
during	this	time	the	data	science	team	began	to	recruit	additional	members	who	were	proficient	in	analytics	and	artificial	intelligence	while	solely	utilizing	the	data	lake
as	more	data	was	uploaded	to	the	cloud	the	bank	saw	steady	movement	of	analytics	teams	from	edw	to	the	cloud
certain	teams	such	as	those	responsible	for	risk	management	continued	to	use	edw	as	their	primary	source
throughout	and	services	and	versions	were	gradually	improved
cloud	based	operations	are	advantageous	due	to	their	convenience	speed	ease	of	platform	maintenance	and	scalability
in	addition	data	center	is	no	longer	necessary
in	the	past	on	premises	scalability	required	the	cloudera	data	platform	to	be	built	in	the	data	center	demanding	numerous	hardware	procurement	and	networking	processes
if	the	system	failed	to	execute	or	perform	the	method	and	script	had	to	be	re	tuned	for	troubleshooting
in	the	past	teradata	was	utilized	as	superior	massive	parallel	processing	mpp	databased	engine	for	operating	data	warehouses	other	than	oracle	which	was	simple	database	system	that	could	only	be	expanded	to	particular	extent	because	activities	slowed	as	more	data	was	added
big	data	platforms	such	as	teradata	began	to	provide	parallel	processing	solution	incorporating	multiple	nodes
however	because	this	method	requires	specialized	infrastructure	teradata	is	exceedingly	costly
due	to	its	greater	speed	compared	to	typical	relational	databases	teradata	dominated	the	market	for	data	warehouses	for	decades
when	open	source	big	data	became	available	however	customers	did	not	expand	their	use	of	teradata	due	to	its	expensive	price
with	the	emergence	of	data	science	big	data	gained	increased	popularity	among	users
using	big	data	customers	can	run	any	historical	data	they	desire	or	conduct	data	queries	as	usual	at	reasonable	cost
price	speed	and	convenience	make	cloud	computing	indisputably	more	cost	effective	and	efficient
since	we	have	been	able	to	execute	tens	of	thousands	of	jobs	and	accumulate	large	quantities	of	data
users	can	easily	configure	property	settings	and	data	older	than	one	year	can	be	separated	into	archives	allowing	the	automatic	transfer	of	files	for	long	term	data	storage
scb	data	system	is	hosted	in	the	cloud	putting	the	bank	ahead	of	the	curve	and	making	scb	the	leading	company	in	thailand	for	data	ai	technology
scb	uploaded	all	its	data	and	migrated	engines	etl	and	logics	to	the	cloud	and	no	longer	requires	data	warehouse
data	governance	has	achieved	new	level	with	cloud	data	lakehouse
now	data	scientists	may	utilize	azure	databricks	which	can	swiftly	examine	data	in	order	to	build	machine	learning	models
instead	of	utilizing	third	party	services	the	bank	has	developed	data	engineering	teams
there	are	now	around	forty	data	engineers	in	existence
teams	of	project	managers	pm	and	function	analysts	fa	with	well	defined	roles	and	have	been	formed
function	analysts	fa	will	perform	the	same	duties	as	business	analysts	ba	who	communicate	directly	with	business	units	regarding	their	requirements	while	project	managers	oversee	the	process
requirements	will	be	submitted	to	the	business	requirements	specifications	brs	and	data	engineer	teams	which	will	include	system	analysts	sa	who	evaluate	how	the	fa	business	requirements	will	be	technically	delivered
prior	to	implementation	it	is	the	responsibility	of	sas	to	map	system	sources
if	business	units	require	extra	information	sas	will	map	data	prior	to	submitting	it	to	the	data	engineer	for	development	and	production	before	releasing	it	to	the	qa	team	for	testing	in	accordance	with	the	cycle
if	the	test	is	successful	the	project	will	proceed	to	the	deployment	phase	where	the	operation	team	will	be	responsible	for	monitoring	the	performance	of	the	system
the	development	team	may	proceed	with	more	initiatives
with	well	defined	roles	projects	may	function	and	progress	efficiently	allowing	employees	to	concentrate	on	their	specific
now	our	clouds	have	scaled	and	been	upgraded	beyond	hdinsight	to	hdi	in	real	time	signals	are	an	additional	innovation	that	debuted	in	before	this	project	was	launched	it	teams	users	and	data	scientist	teams	engaged	in	extensive	deliberation
using	powerbi	dashboard	to	animate	graphs	prototype	was	produced	for	senior	managements	consideration
in	circumstances	of	actual	usage	data	will	be	communicated	to	scb	line	connect
for	instance	fund	transfer	data	will	be	mapped	into	data	science	model	before	submitting	to	scb	line	connect
additionally	they	can	retrieve	information	including	scb	easy	transactions
when	customer	completes	transaction	the	real	time	platform	will	receive	the	data	and	the	data	team	will	transmit	real	time	data	to	the	data	lakehouse	in	order	to	construct	use	case	which	will	then	be	sent	to	the	data	science	team	for	matching	with	campaigns	such	as	selecting	appropriate	product	offers	to	send	to	customers
scb	does	not	stop	there	and	continues	to	improve	the	effectiveness	of	its	systems
in	addition	machine	learning	is	used	to	monitor	jobs	by	analyzing	log	data	and	predicting	which	processes	are	experiencing	problems	and	how	long	it	will	take	to	rerun	problematic	data
this	function	will	ease	the	process	of	notifying	users	of	problems	while	the	dependency	graphs	generated	will	make	it	easier	for	the	operations	team	to	visualize	the	situation
scb	has	advanced	to	the	next	level	by	establishing	company	specializing	in	cutting	edge	data	and	artificial	intelligence	services
this	procedure	has	made	the	structure	of	the	centralized	data	platform	even	more	obvious
the	establishment	of	scb	datax	will	radically	alter	the	duties	of	data	teams
the	scbx	group	has	established	group	companies	in	variety	of	industries	with	datax	serving	as	the	hub	of	all	data	and	providing	data	and	artificial	intelligence	related	services
to	accomplish	this	purpose	datax	must	develop	new	monoline	platform	for	other	scbx	subsidiaries
datax	will	develop	data	platform	to	support	the	data	analytics	efforts	of	group	firms
concurrently	we	must	undertake	cloud	based	data	sharing
after	uploading	data	to	the	centralized	pool	direct	monoline	connection	must	be	made	to	each	client	company	which	could	number	up	to	twenty
the	procedure	has	been	advancing
maintaining	the	platform	and	regulating	data	exchange	would	be	the	more	difficult	tasks	for	datax	to	overcome
each	company	has	its	own	collection	of	skilled	employees
the	logical	change	is	identical	but	the	platforms	are	unique
consequently	data	exchange	will	necessitate	consent	which	must	be	handled	with	caution
in	the	past	when	scb	was	single	entity	and	all	users	reported	to	scb	data	governance	was	straightforward
the	use	of	data	on	the	monoline	platform	will	necessitate	legal	procedure	involving	consent	requests
when	businesses	are	spun	off	each	acquires	its	own	data	source
this	requires	completely	new	system
this	procedure	involves	data	mapping	for	the	monoline	platform	in	order	to	construct	group	wide	data	sharing	system
bringing	the	data	system	to	higher	level	is	difficult	undertaking	for	the	datax	team
there	is	currently	no	company	in	the	country	that	can	spin	out	data	specialized	company
the	majority	of	businesses	in	thailand	continue	to	utilize	data	warehouses	administered	by	it	departments	data	officers	or	business	unit	teams
datax	utilizes	cutting	edge	tools	technologies	and	platforms	validated	and	positioned	in	the	leader	quadrant	by	management	consulting	firm	gartner
datax	will	be	data	lake	house	data	integration	offering	advanced	and	comprehensive	data	ai	services	to	address	the	individual	demands	of	each	business	thereby	elevating	the	level	of	the	customer	experience	that	will	contribute	to	the	profitability	and	success	of	the	scbx	family	of	enterprises
scb	foresight	in	understanding	the	significance	of	data	was	important	in	making	scb	datax	reality	today
datax	would	not	exist	if	senior	management	had	not	taken	this	matter	seriously
it	illustrates	the	goal	of	the	scbx	mothership	to	lead	the	entire	conglomerate	into	the	blue	ocean	where	various	business	opportunities	lie	utilizing	data	as	compass	to	direct	the	group	through	the	door	of	business	opportunities	using	data	and	smart	technology	to	lead	the	scbx	group	to	success

instant	noodles	it	is	one	of	the	sustenance	foods	that	every	home	must	have
the	role	of	instant	noodles	is	symbol	of	hustle	and	bustle	and	cost	savings
but	for	vietnamese	people	the	factor	that	makes	them	consume	more	instant	noodles	is	part	of	the	way	of	life	of	vietnamese	people	has	changed
nowadays	there	are	many	multinational	companies	investing	in	vietnam
vietnamese	people	have	higher	incomes
it	is	more	popular	to	eat	out	to	change	the	atmosphere	of	the	meal	or	use	the	restaurant	as	meeting	place
but	when	covid	heavy	epidemic	restaurants	are	the	top	business	ordered	to	close	for	social	distancing
people	were	unable	to	eat	like	before
instant	noodles	ready	to	brew	with	various	flavors	came	to	play	greater	role	in	the	vietnamese	way	of	life	especially	flavors	from	foreign	countries	such	as	korea	japan	thailand	etc	convenient	when	having	to	live	in	the	house
the	behavior	of	vietnamese	consumers	in	consuming	instant	noodles	has	variety	of	purposes	such	as	eating	when	it	urgent
eat	for	sustenance	in	everyday	life
eat	to	follow	the	trend
reduce	the	complexity	of	cooking	etc
the	price	of	instant	noodles	is	quite	different	from	to	vnd	pack	baht	pack
today	let	get	to	know	the	giants	of	the	instant	noodle	industry	that	dominate	the	vietnamese	market
the	market	leader	in	vietnamese	instant	noodles	is	hao	hao	from	japanese	company	acecook
who	successfully	entered	the	market	in	vietnam	previously	disappointed	in	the	vietnamese	market	due	to	expensive	products
later	the	price	was	reduced
as	result	sales	increased	continuously
because	they	are	better	quality	instant	noodles	than	the	cheaper	local	brands
until	becoming	the	national	noodle	of	vietnam	it	occupies	the	country	largest	market	share	of	instant	noodles
followed	by	omachi	and	kokomi	from	masan	consumer	giant	of	vietnamese	consumer	products
it	started	by	selling	instant	noodles	to	vietnamese	people	in	russia
and	expanded	its	products	to	soy	sauce	chili	sauce	and	fish	sauce	and	currently	owns	the	crownx	platform	in	cooperation	with	alibaba	and	vingroup
meet	the	needs	of	consumers	and	creating	good	shopping	experience	for	consumers	and	survey	by	kantar	worldpanel	global	expert	on	consumer	behavior	found	that	of	vietnamese	people	must	use	at	least	one	product	from	masan	group
the	third	one	is	mi	gau	do	from	asia	food	company	authentic	vietnamese	instant	noodles	which	is	reputed	to	be	the	leader	in	the	country	major	ready	to	eat	foods	with	history	of	more	than	years	there	are	production	plants	in	the	country

to	create	an	online	identity	the	tools	used	are	website	and	facebook
you	need	to	be	reliable	and	trustworthy	have	expertise	or	be	able	to	solve	problems	for	customers
because	customers	will	check	their	brand	identity	from	the	website
doesn	need	to	have	every	platform	but	one	website	and	social	media	is	enough
therefore	in	the	online	world	brand	identity	must	have	distinctive	selling	points	that	are	clearly	different
and	find	out	what	customers	want	and	we	have	to	exceed	their	expectations
value	proposition	the	value	we	deliver	to	our	customers

our	world	is	gray
therefore	there	is	loneliness	as	friend	even	during	people	but	feel	that	no	one	quotes	in	the	online	world	reflecting	the	deep	emotions	hidden	in	the	minds	of	people	in	the	digital	age	with	technology	as	friends
causing	the	question	that	in	an	age	where	communication	is	connected	just	handful	of	mobile	phones	but	why	do	people	feel	lonely
when	it	comes	to	loneliness	it	is	an	emotional	state	that	can	happen	to	everyone	for	example	no	one	is	listening	to	the	problem
people	around	you	do	not	have	time	to	feel	unified	with	society	in	psychology	it	is	also	said	that	loneliness
show	the	relationship	in	society	that	we	want	to	be	different	from	the	truth	such	as	wanting	everyone	to	be	friendly
but	the	reality	is	the	enemy
it	causes	feeling	of	loneliness	because	the	relationship	is	not	as	expected
with	the	trend	of	loneliness	marketers	around	the	world	have	turned	their	attention	to	studying	behavior	in	order	to	reach	and	understand	the	needs	of	this	group	and	thus	open	the	blue	waters	to	create	new	market	opportunities	for	lonely	consumers
anyone	is	lonely	it	is	not	wrong	if	you	are	lonely	because	all	over	the	world	are	lonely
in	foreign	countries	the	trend	of	the	lonely	population	is	increasing
in	england	survey	found	that	the	number	of	loneliness	reaches	million	that	the	ministry	of	loneliness	must	be	established	to	take	care	of	the	mental	health	of	these	populations
to	give	advice	and	arrange	activities	to	help	the	lonely	to	restore	their	mental	state
in	america	research	has	found	that	three	quarters	of	the	population	of	the	people	in	gen	aged	years	are	the	loneliest
for	thailand	there	has	been	market	research	for	lonely	people
by	the	college	of	management	mahidol	university	from	sample	of	people	there	are	million	people	lonely	in	thailand	accounting	for	of	the	thai	population
the	group	was	divided	into	secretive	loneliness	familiarity	and	lonely
according	to	the	research	it	was	found	that	the	group	with	the	highest	loneliness	was	working	age	years	old	followed	by	of	school	age	loneliness	years	old	and	followed	by	adulthood
lonely	years	old
while	old	age	the	lowest	level	of	loneliness	was	over	because	they	were	emotionally	organized	and	mentally	prepared
when	looking	at	the	relationship	between	loneliness	and	income	factors	it	was	found	that	more	income	less	lonely	less	income	very	lonely
of	the	lonely	people	who	earn	less	than	baht	say	that	they	are	lonely	because	they	do	not	have	money	to	go	out	or	go	shopping	because	they	have	other	burdens	to	pay	including	housing	car	payments	etc
how	to	cure	the	loneliness	of	the	lonely	the	survey	found	that	there	are	methods	that	can	be	used	to	relieve	yourself	of	loneliness
lonely	people	market	business	opportunities	college	of	management	mahidol	university	cmmu	mentioned	that	the	lonely	market	in	thailand	has	reached	million	people
as	result	the	business	group	that	supports	the	lonely	market	has	increased
in	foreign	countries	there	is	business	to	penetrate	the	lonely	market	such	as	the	united	states	there	is	papa	app	service	called	people	to	help	care	for	the	elderly	such	as	helping	with	housework
take	it	to	shop	or	see	doctor
and	has	the	people	walk	app	to	find	friends	to	exercise	in	japan	uncle	rental	ossan	rental	is	available	as	consultant	advising	or	solving	problems	for	lonely	people	or	people	with	stress
in	thailand	community	businesses	that	please	lonely	people	and	have	gained	popularity	in	the	past	such	as	restaurants	cafes	board	games
co	working	space	business	digital	businesses	such	as	apps	for	making	friends	or	dating
party	app	to	find	people	divide	in	various	matters
pet	service	businesses	such	as	hospitals	clinics	pet	sanctuaries	travel	business	in	the	form	of	doing	social	activities	strategies	for	lonely	people	as	mentioned	above	there	are	million	lonely	people	in	thailand	how	do	they	do	business	to	ensure	the	needs	of	this	population
college	of	management	mahidol	university	cmmu	recommends	the	following	strategies	the	lonely	population	is	another	social	group	of	people	that	businessmen	or	marketers	should	pay	attention	to
create	products	and	services	or	run	promotions
to	meet	the	needs	of	this	group	of	people	it	will	be	new	target	group	in	the	blue	waters	that	will	help	increase	sales	and	generate	income	for	products	and	services	continuously	in	the	future

to	survive	you	must	think	outside	the	comfort	zone
when	the	context	changes	if	stick	to	the	original	business	framework	it	will	not	survive
let	hear	how	to	think	about	how	to	apply	existing	core	expertise	to	new	markets	using	data	as	navigation	compass	with	khun	max	phattharaphon	phosuwan	ceo	and	co	founder	eventpop
despite	how	severe	the	covid	is	thai	startups	like	eventpop	are	not	going	to	back	off
what	concept	of	adaptation	and	how	to	draw	on	strengths	to	expand	business	he	has	we	will	study	here
the	starting	point	of	eventpop	ticket	platform	eventpop	started	five	years	ago	in	khun	max	had	business	maker	space	for	inventors	to	learn
most	of	which	are	children	that	come	to	learn	things	such	as	printing
he	provided	workshops	when	it	comes	to	organizing	workshop	he	had	to	do	marketing	sales	and	register	online
therefore	found	that	there	is	no	system	that	is	easy	to	use	and	supports	thai	behavior
so	eventpop	was	created	with	the	original	purpose	of	being	for	personal	use
after	using	it	himself	for	while	he	started	to	let	others	use	it
until	he	met	angle	investor	which	is	khun	tob	taokaenoi
khun	tob	came	in	and	invited	that	he	should	be	serious	and	see	that	the	market	needs	this	kind	of	system
khun	max	background	is	programmer	therefore	did	not	think	much	about	business
but	when	khun	tob	invited	him	to	do	seriously	it	is	the	beginning
after	that	he	entered	highly	competitive	industry	such	as	the	music	festival	with	the	first	event	was	waterzonic
therefore	he	has	seen	an	opportunity	that	when	there	is	good	system	it	can	be	done	in	every	job	whether	small	or	large	in	all	industries
which	should	be	good	for	thailand	especially	the	event	industry
initially	there	were	about	jobs	until	later	growing	up	with	about	jobs	year
over	the	past	years	about	jobs
what	is	ticket	platform
ticket	platform	is	channel	for	selling	tickets
which	will	take	care	of	the	registration	manage	people	who	are	registered	manage	finances	crm	manage	crm	it	is	known	as	an	end	to	end	solution	that	makes	events	of	all	scale	more	accessible	to	consumers
make	people	see	the	opportunity	that	the	event	can	be	organized	more	easily
causing	more	and	more	events	to	be	organized
using	data	to	develop	events	max	said	that	really	let	start	with	the	organizers	restrictions
from	the	original	to	know	which	group	of	people	attending	the	event	or	how	many	people	join
before	you	must	do	survey	you	must	fill	out	the	information	before	entering	to	collect	the	information
but	when	it	comes	to	online	these	data	are	all	contained	in	the	same	database	bin
can	bring	the	data	to	analyze	it	information	will	be	filtered	out	like	the	participants	were	more	female	or	male
and	able	to	analyze	what	things	they	are	interested	in
it	can	be	used	to	plan	what	points	or	what	topic	to	say
even	information	about	spending	money	on	work	that	made	payment	system	as	wristband	you	can	see	which	restaurants	are	selling	well
information	on	spending	that	occurred	in	the	event	can	be	studied	immediately	such	as	in	which	stores	have	the	long	line	or	where	is	the	person	going	to	be	in	any	zone
khun	max	gave	an	example	of	selling	drinks	which	is	key	factor	in	the	event
solving	the	covid	problem	by	thinking	outside	the	box	when	it	comes	to	the	important	question	of	how	eventpop	is	affected	by	covid
khun	max	said	that	in	february	to	april	no	new	events	at	all
but	march	and	april	are	very	busy
but	busy	in	refunding	customers	instead
the	decline	of	tourists	has	led	to	the	disappearance	of	seminars	such	as	the	mice	group	that	brought	foreigners	to	thailand
international	concerts	like	edm	were	also	affected	lot	because	most	of	the	audience	was	chinese
which	began	to	see	the	impact	since	january	that	the	chinese	tourist	group	disappeared
from	before	the	coronavirus	that	max	called	stay	in	the	shell	of	the	event	when	faced	with	major	crisis	like	covid	forced	him	to	think	outside	the	box
start	thinking	about	what	to	do	next
try	to	find	backup	plan	try	to	organize	an	online	event
invited	existing	customers	to	do	it	but	failed	because	the	customer	decided	to	stop	working	because	they	thought	it	was	not	worth	it
until	meeting	penguin	eat	shabu	which	is	like	person	who	is	in	trouble	must	find	way	to	survive
trying	to	think	outside	the	box	has	therefore	been	applied
changing	from	selling	event	tickets	to	selling	shabu	pot	instead
khun	max	compares	that	it	like	two	stalled	dogs	meet
trying	to	find	way	to	work	together	to	win	together
the	problem	is	that	the	penguins	want	to	sell	lot	of	shabu	pot	products	for	limited	time
one	minute	thousands	of	people	bought	shabu	pots
it	is	the	duty	of	eventpop	to	make	people	feel	that	the	product	is	limited	and	must	buy	it	in	limited	time
can	see	the	number	of	people	ordering	in	real	time
after	working	with	penguins	many	restaurants	contacted	him	but	had	to	refuse	to	go	to	many	stores	because	the	system	was	still	unable	to	accept	too	many	places	at	the	same	time
that	is	possible	because	the	to	system	is	fully	supported	in	the	past	two	months	vouchers	have	been	sold	in	bulk	and	are	able	to	accept	customers	from	various	industries
that	is	possible	because	the	to	system	is	fully	supported	in	the	past	two	months	vouchers	have	been	sold	in	bulk	and	are	able	to	accept	customers	from	various	industries
deflect	to	online	events	with	virtual	conference	success	prototype	khun	max	sees	hosting	events	online	as	an	escape
which	is	not	new	overseas	are	already	organized
at	first	he	admitted	that	he	wasn	sure	that	he	would	succeed	but	he	wasn	afraid	to	do	it
the	first	month	there	were	no	customers	at	all	despite	shooting	thousand	emails	to	email	everything	went	silent
until	met	the	standard	who	wanted	to	organize	forum	as	the	first	job	of	countries	that	are	online
the	standard	already	has	ideas	and	khun	max	team	helps	with	technology	and	live	streaming
which	was	the	first	time	to	do
everything	had	problem
but	what	he	was	ready	to	do	was	keep	the	problems	and	fix	them
there	was	working	time	of	days	to	solve	the	problem
but	everyone	solved	the	problem	and	tried	to	cope	with	every	problem	until	the	end	the	work	came	out	very	well
khun	max	said	that	thanks	to	the	standard	saw	good	example	of	virtual	conferences	in	thailand	and	after	the	event	people	understood	what	virtual	conference	is	and	got	lot	of	contacts
what	is	the	eventpop	core	of	competence
max	recalled	that	after	working	with	the	penguins	we	originally	thought	of	events	but	never	thought	that	someone	else	could	use	our	system
so	we	removed	the	words	ticket	event
and	see	the	core	competence	of	the	company	that	can	be	applied	in	other	industries
the	core	of	eventpop	is	specialize	in	sales
specialize	in	crisis	management	and	expectation	management
flexible	technology	capable	of	supporting	wide	variety	of	products
expertise	in	to	offline	to	online	and	online	to	offline	hints	where	to	start	what	to	stop	and	what	to	do	next
start	to	see	who	our	customers	are
because	if	you	can	look	at	the	customer	image	you	won	be	able	to	move	on	data	and	crm	are	the	points	to	win	online	and	better	online	marketing
stop	being	afraid
we	are	often	taught	that	if	we	do	anything	we	must	be	different
but	when	we	started	it	all	had	competitors	and	nothing	was	new
if	we	start	out	fearing	that	we	have	competitors	we	close	ourselves	up
selling	food	people	sell	it	lot
but	in	truth	customers	just	want	something	better
it	doesn	have	to	be	different
continue	walking	on	even	if	there	is	no	covid	something	new	must	be	done
constantly	challenged	so	you	must	go	on
live	in	the	present	and	in	the	future	not	in	the	past
must	pass	through	never	give	up	never	stop	walking	if	you	can	see	your	true	strengths	and	abilities	not	sticking	to	the	same	old	familiar	frame	and	not	afraid	to	try	and	do	something	new
the	crisis	can	become	an	opportunity	to	see	the	potential	hidden	within	us
including	opening	new	business	opportunities	that	can	be	way	to	survive	and	to	grow	your	business	in	the	future

while	every	corner	of	the	world	is	at	war	with	an	epidemic	no	one	knows	when	it	will	end
during	this	time	business	owners	and	sme	entrepreneurs	must	adapt	very	hard	in	order	to	sustain	their	businesses	to	survive
and	business	owners	what	should	an	entrepreneur	do
in	an	economic	downturn	amid	such	an	epidemic	would	like	to	introduce	lessons	that	commerce	master	jack	ma	has	been	able	to	successfully	lead	the	kingdom	to	escape	the	sars	crisis	in	until	it	has	grown	to	this	day
back	in	march	there	was	mysterious	epidemic	sars	that	caused	acute	respiratory	infections
spread	in	countries	around	the	world	at	the	time	more	than	people	were	infected
nearly	people	died
at	that	time	jack	ma	had	just	founded	alibaba	commerce	online	wholesale	in	only	years	had	heavy	battle	with	the	epidemic	crisis
china	while	the	company	still	has	no	profit
at	that	time	alibaba	had	project	to	launch	retail	commerce	like	taobao	had	to	slow	down
chinese	stores	were	closed	making	alibaba	an	online	wholesale	business	inevitably	affected
alibaba	main	retailer	was	unable	to	sell	their	products	and	consumers	were	not	buying	because	they	had	to	stay	at	home
moreover	the	company	has	employees	with	sars	because	of	going	to	the	fair
as	result	chinese	authorities	temporarily	closed	the	company
causing	everyone	to	be	detained	at	home	in	the	corner	of	businessman	is	disaster
certainly	not	with	man	named	jack	ma
what	did	jack	ma	do	to	save	the	crisis	in	the	past
employee	safety	is	the	most	important	thing	jack	ma	has	raised	huge	budget	for	the	health	care	of	employees
because	if	one	employee	is	sick	it	may	affect	other	employees	and	ultimately	will	affect	the	overall	operations	of	the	company	therefore	the	health	of	employees	must	come	before	the	company	income
and	when	an	employee	is	infected	with	an	epidemic	he	immediately	orders	all	employees	to	work	from	home	accept	the	truth	all	work	has	been	postponed	indefinitely
customers	cancel	the	product
the	thing	that	jack	ma	said	to	employees	is	that	change	is	normal
don	just	stick	to	the	lost	opportunity
because	it	does	not	help	us	to	plan	for	new	opportunities	in	the	future	do	not	just	sit	and	think	of	the	damage
or	trying	to	call	for	help	just	accept	the	truth	and	move	forward
the	faster	the	change	is	accepted	will	only	find	new	opportunities	faster	and	that	where	jack	ma	immediately	looked	for	opportunities	from	retail	commerce	plan	like	taobao	website
decisions	must	be	made	now	and	made	with	heart	when	faced	with	crisis	of	course	business	people	have	to	figure	out	the	cost	of	how	they	can	survive
how	much	does	it	have	to	be	reduced
many	times	have	to	make	difficult	decisions	which	most	people	tend	to	do	later	but	the	slow	decision	made	things	worse
jack	ma	said	that	when	it	was	necessary	to	keep	the	company	it	should	be	done
one	of	the	decisions	that	operators	will	encounter	in	times	of	crisis	such	as	the	discontinuation	of	business
temporary	or	permanent	termination	at	that	time	jack	ma	thought	very	hard	because	employees	have	been	suffering	for	long	time
but	must	make	the	decision	as	soon	as	possible	and	must	do	with	the	heart	because	jack	ma	had	made	mistake	when	the	dotcom	bubble	crisis	occurred	when	an	employee	needs	to	lay	off	what	jack	ma	does	is	the	phone	and	talk	to	that	employee	himself
tell	employees	that	even	after	leaving	they	must	always	keep	in	touch
and	when	the	company	can	overcome	the	crisis	promise	to	get	back	to	work	and	he	fulfilled	the	promise	he	had	made	unity	is	power	during	the	sars	crisis	jack	ma	communicated	directly	with	employees	about	the	problems	they	faced
requesting	cooperation	from	employees	and	ways	to	overcome	the	crisis	of	the	company	to	help	employees	understand	that	alibaba	survival	is	not	just	for	alibaba	itself	it	also	means	that	the	entire	business	chain	related	to	alibaba	is	able	to	survive	this	crisis
in	addition	the	company	uses	the	internal	system	to	communicate	with	employees	regularly
in	order	to	create	morale	for	unity	and	periodically	understand	the	situation	of	the	company	as	well	as	providing	equipment	for	employees	to	be	able	to	work	at	home	conveniently	as	well	in	which	most	employees	understand	and	cooperate	well	everyone	is	carrying	desktop	computer	back	to	work	at	home
and	each	person	works	hard	hours	day	so	that	customers	are	not	affected	by	work	from	home	as	well
for	employees	who	are	sick	jack	ma	will	give	break	immediately	and	call	to	encourage
in	addition	even	if	employees	are	scattered	jack	ma	also	organizes	activities	for	unity	such	as	online	karaoke	competitions	chatting	activities	among	fellow	employees	etc
looking	for	opportunities	in	the	midst	of	crisis	there	is	always	chance	of	crisis
jack	ma	said	look	for	opportunities	that	which	groups	of	customers	still	have	potential
how	can	the	company	help	those	customers
and	he	can	see	that	sme	customers	all	over	the	country	have	potential	but	have	small	capital
opening	shop	during	an	epidemic	is	difficult
if	using	online	tools	to	help	this	group	of	customers	grow	alibaba	will	be	able	to	survive	as	well
alibaba	has	also	collaborated	with	the	government	to	invite	smes	offline	stores	to	be	on	the	online	platform
although	the	sars	epidemic	has	not	yet	ended
jack	ma	decided	to	launch	the	online	retail	website	taobao	on	may	and	was	well	received
because	the	sars	outbreak	causes	consumers	to	want	to	buy	products	and	services	online	while	sellers	are	looking	for	ways	to	sell	products	on	the	day	that	the	store	can	open
and	finally	just	few	years	later	taobao	successfully	beat	china	market	share	from	ebay	ultimately	though	the	lessons	of	jack	ma	during	the	sars	crisis	were	not	as	severe	as	the	covid	crisis	that	occurred	at	this	time	but	one	thing	is	clear	good	leaders	will	be	able	to	protect	employees	with	heart
with	wide	vision	not	attached	to	the	same	things	and	ready	to	accept	changes	that	are	not	always	predictable	like	said	is	the	leader	good	or	not
to	see	in	times	of	crisis	reference	professional	and	comprehensive	business	management	solution
new	digital	banking	platform	to	enhance	the	financial	experience	for	business	customers
in	an	era	that	the	world	has	changed	upside	down	the	superpowers	are	no	longer	the	leaders
thick	budget	does	not	guarantee	any	success
platforms	disrupt	the	former	way	of	business
these	happens	so	fast	and	entrepreneurs	will	have	to	face	with	the	challenges	that	are	hard	to	foresee
to	provide	shields	that	helps	entrepreneurs	in	business	scb	came	up	with	programme	for	thai	sme	to	be	ready	to	become	game	changers	with	the	dots	hotel	game	changer
this	will	help	hotel	entrepreneurs	to	grow	sustainably	and	last	long	in	this	disruption	era
change	before	being	disrupted	when	the	way	of	doing	business	and	the	environment	have	changed	worldwide	due	to	the	changing	consumer	behavior	the	old	way	of	doing	business	has	to	be	changed	accordingly
this	goes	the	same	for	the	bank	and	hotel	business
mrs	pikul	srimahan	senior	vice	manager	and	the	senior	manager	for	the	sme	segment	at	siam	commercial	bank	public	company	limited	felt	that	the	banking	business	has	been	disrupted	just	like	how	publishing	business	encountered
in	the	past	banks	mainly	provided	deposit	withdrawal	transfer	or	loan	services
however	nowadays	people	are	doing	transactions	through	phone	applications	and	they	hardly	go	to	bank	branches	anymore
moreover	there	are	new	players	who	loan	or	raise	funds	without	having	bank	as	medium
when	all	these	happened	banks	will	have	to	change	for	their	own	survival
bring	out	the	best	weapon	to	the	platform	the	challenge	that	banks	are	facing	now	is	to	change	themselves	to	become	more	than	just	bank
pikul	said	that	banks	will	have	to	become	platform
when	the	customers	come	to	the	bank	they	will	not	just	come	to	request	credits	or	compare	which	bank	offers	the	lowest	loan	rate
but	when	the	customers	come	to	the	bank	they	will	seek	business	advisors	and	banks	will	have	to	serve	as	their	partner	who	will	help	them	from	starting	to	the	finishing	line	on	what	to	do	to	succeed
also	banks	can	expand	from	the	capital	that	they	are	rich	in	which	is	big	data
with	the	data	they	have	and	their	expertise	in	doing	business	in	various	sectors	they	can	use	data	to	analyze	and	find	the	right	solution	for	entrepreneurs	including	business	matching	customer	finding	marketing	insight	analysis	technology	support	expense	reduction	etc
these	put	clients	and	banks	into	win	win	situation	and	this	is	an	upside	down	shift	of	banking	business
teach	an	elephant	how	to	dance	to	do	business	that	one	can	lose	in	just	blink	of	an	eye	one	has	to	think	of	way	to	survive	when	the	business	context	changed
there	is	lesson	in	survival	tips	that	can	be	brought	to	practice	which	is	to	teach	an	elephant	how	to	dance	to	make	the	organization	the	lightest	in	weight	or	to	lean	the	organization
pikul	gave	an	example	that	scb	has	employees	and	branches
the	bank	asked	the	managers	of	each	sector	to	do	positive	jaws	which	is	the	comparison	of	profits	and	expenses	ratio
each	business	unit	will	have	to	monitor	how	to	reduce	their	expenses	and	ensure	that	the	ratio	of	their	profits	must	be	more	than	expenses
as	for	the	hotel	business	they	have	to	know	what	their	profit	structure	is	consisted	of
for	example	the	majority	of	the	budget	comes	from	people
what	is	regular	and	irregular	expenditure
what	can	increase	profit
after	all	income	and	expenditure	are	known	we	will	then	be	able	to	see	the	way	to	make	more	profits	than	expenses
when	the	business	is	leaner	the	company	will	be	able	to	survive
knowing	how	to	carefully	control	financial	statements	is	the	key	for	business	to	survive	in	this	era	apart	from	changing	the	business	structure	obtaining	knowledge	and	adapting	to	society	as	well	as	strategic	thinking	on	creating	innovation	are	parts	of	important	factors	to	survive	in	this	era
mr	thana	thienachariya	sevp	chief	marketing	officer	and	head	of	external	communication	csr	acting	at	siam	commercial	bank	public	company	limited	talked	about	changes	and	perceptions	of	people	in	different	generations	that	is	there	anyone	who	know	arnold	schwarzenegger	in	this	room
people	of	my	generation	all	of	them	know	him
but	when	ask	the	younger	generation	the	same	question	the	majority	of	them	have	no	idea	who	schwarzenegger	is
the	word	bts	would	mean	an	abbreviation	of	the	sky	train	for	people	of	my	generation	but	the	name	of	the	pop	boy	band	for	the	younger	generation
what	does	this	tell	us
the	society	of	this	era	is	highly	digital	divided
the	pictures	that	people	of	each	generation	perceive	are	different
if	we	take	piece	of	paper	with	thickness	of	millimeters	and	fold	it	over	and	over	times	what	is	the	thickness	of	this	piece	of	paper	after	folding
the	answer	is	it	is	equivalent	to	the	distance	from	the	earth	to	the	moon
this	changing	world	is	exponential	but	people	think	linearly
the	generation	gap	is	so	obvious	in	both	knowledge	and	feeling
it	has	become	so	confusing	micro	moment	the	villain	that	changes	the	world	in	these	past	years	human	behavior	has	changed	since	the	invention	of	mobile	phones
thana	mentioned	that	the	action	of	checking	on	our	phone	over	and	over	from	the	moment	we	wake	up	to	the	time	before	we	go	to	bed	gives	birth	to	the	new	behavioral	trend	of	humans
the	great	micro	moment	that	happened
everybody	uses	smartphone	an	average	of	times	day
thai	people	ranked	first	in	the	world	for	using	mobile	internet	at	an	average	of	hours	per	day
this	shows	that	the	smartphone	has	become	part	of	peoples	lives	in	this	era	also	from	peoples	increasing	behavior	in	using	smartphones	the	attention	economy	happens
thana	noticed	and	said	that	and	we	see	that	platforms	like	facebook	youtube	netflix	online	games	etc
are	trying	to	attract	attention	from	people
they	try	to	make	people	stay	and	look	at	the	screen	as	long	as	possible
this	is	because	the	more	people	looking	at	the	screen	the	richer	these	platforms	will	get
netflix	even	thinks	that	bedtime	is	their	enemy
if	they	can	win	over	this	sleeping	time	they	can	gain	even	more	profit	than	they	can	ever	imagine
and	this	is	how	scary	attention	economy	is	who	is	behind	disruption
in	world	that	every	moment	in	life	is	knitted	to	smartphones	the	consumers	behavior	changes	rapidly
this	is	the	cause	that	disrupts	many	businesses
thana	expressed	his	thought	that	people	nowadays	search	whatever	they	want	to	know	on	google
if	they	want	to	buy	something	they	will	look	up	product	reviews
if	they	want	to	travel	they	will	trust	tripadvisor
if	they	want	to	make	anything	they	look	for	tutorials	on	youtube
this	is	what	disrupts	the	business
recently	gave	lecture	at	university
professor	told	me	that	when	they	were	teaching	their	students	would	check	on	the	phone	to	see	if	they	were	taught	correctly
this	is	the	disruption	that	happened
so	the	true	disruption	is	customers	impatient	confused	spoiled	descriptions	of	consumers	in	this	era	thana	described	the	common	traits	of	consumers	in	this	era	that	the	first	point	is	age	of	now
by	observation	people	nowadays	are	impatient
they	cant	afford	to	wait
if	they	want	something	they	expect	to	have	it	right	here	right	now
in	the	past	if	the	air	conditioner	was	broken	at	night	people	of	my	generation	would	wait	till	morning	to	call	for	the	maintenance	service	but	people	nowadays	wouldnt	wait	that	long
the	second	point	is	there	is	lots	of	information	circling	around	every	day
we	consume	so	much	news	but	we	hardly	remember	any
its	confusing
we	can	see	that	if	there	is	any	crisis	nobody	has	to	do	anything	just	left	it	alone	for	days	and	nobody	remembers	anymore
because	there	is	too	much	information	there	is	comparison	over	species
for	example	if	we	get	into	restaurant	and	we	have	an	application	to	show	membership	we	can	get	discount
then	we	want	to	change	our	cars	tire	and	we	need	to	show	our	membership	card	to	get	discount
there	is	comparison	between	the	restaurant	and	the	garage	which	to	be	honest	they	are	under	different	categories
lastly	this	is	the	age	of	choice
people	nowadays	have	plenty	of	choices
in	this	era	many	things	are	cheap	and	free
people	are	being	spoiled	lot
there	are	no	charges	in	banking
food	delivery	only	costs	baht
free	delivery	charge	for	commerce
people	will	go	for	free	service	and	those	who	charge	will	lose	in	this	business	war
people	are	lack	loyalty	and	this	is	the	true	age	of	disruption	stingy	slow	sloppy	descriptions	of	business	that	refuses	to	change	thana	talked	about	the	old	way	of	doing	business	and	it	does	not	meet	the	demand	of	customers	of	this	generation	that	the	business	that	operates	the	same	as	what	they	did	years	ago	if	they	do	not	change	customers	will	perceive	them	negatively
if	they	charge	for	even	petty	service	the	customers	will	think	that	they	are	stingy
if	the	processes	are	too	long	and	too	many	the	customers	will	feel	that	they	are	slow	and	if	the	reality	doesnt	match	the	expectation	of	the	customers	that	business	is	sloppy
for	example	hotel	has	can	of	carbonated	drink	in	their	mini	bar	and	it	costs	baht	while	the	exact	same	product	costs	baht	on	the	shelf	in	the	nearby	guests	will	start	to	perceive	that	the	hotel	is	so	stingy
another	example	would	be	purchase	through	commerce	that	can	be	done	by	just	clicks	while	buying	from	shopping	mall	requires	one	to	go	out	of	the	house
if	the	seller	isnt	there	one	will	have	to	wait
if	one	wants	discount	membership	card	needs	to	be	presented
from	the	examples	we	can	see	that	the	business	has	changed	into	linear	pattern	but	customers	have	changed	into	an	exponential	patterns
this	makes	the	business	unable	to	catch	up	with	their	customers	because	the	expectation	of	customers	has	changed	drastically
when	the	customers	are	not	satisfied	they	feel	the	pain
this	is	the	beginning	where	the	new	players	come	in	to	ease	this	pain	think	like	startup	thinking	like	startup	is	what	business	should	study
thana	said	that	startup	business	found	their	stand	from	easing	the	pain	for	customers
they	think	of	how	to	create	customer	engagement	with	customers
they	think	not	of	the	profits	or	income
this	method	is	the	opposite	of	how	other	business	does	but	it	matches	customers	needs	because	this	is	the	way	to	ease	the	pain	for	customers
for	example	commerce	offers	free	delivery	and	is	willing	to	lose	their	profits	for	years	to	gain	more	customers
they	want	more	customer	engagement	for	even	more	data	and	they	can	use	the	data	they	obtained	for	other	businesses
this	is	what	disrupts	business	like	ours	because	startup	attempts	to	do	what	other	businesses	cant
they	try	to	ease	pain	and	become	better	faster	and	cheaper
now	how	can	businesses	deal	with	this	rapid	change
when	technology	changes	so	fast	and	no	matter	how	much	we	buy	we	can	never	catch	up	trial	and	error	to	reinvent	the	new	business	that	hits	right	in	customers	heart	want	to	recommend	this	quote	by	mr	prapas	cholsaranon
he	said	success	comes	from	making	the	right	decision
the	right	decision	comes	from	experience
and	where	does	the	experience	come	from
experience	comes	from	making	the	wrong	decision
if	we	have	never	made	mistake	we	can	never	have	the	experience
so	the	courage	to	make	mistake	starts	from	stepping	out	of	the	comfort	zone
only	when	we	are	out	of	our	comfort	zone	that	we	will	dare	to	commit	an	error
the	problem	of	the	present	world	is	that	the	former	experience	does	not	work	here
this	is	the	problem
and	how	do	we	catch	up	with	customers	new	experiences
the	answer	is	trial	and	error	the	trap	that	stops	the	change	the	important	point	that	makes	most	of	the	business	stuck	in	the	process	of	change	is	the	old	knowledge	that	contributed	to	the	success	and	most	business	cannot	get	over	their	achievement
thana	talked	about	this	knowledge	that	the	set	of	knowledge	that	we	called	experience	is	blocking	our	courage
for	example	marvel	cinematic	universe	picked	directors	who	have	never	directed	any	superhero	movies	before	for	their	movies
this	makes	their	movie	novel	for	this	theme	and	gains	them	tremendous	success
another	example	would	be	the	making	of	the	girl	group	bnk
the	idea	originator	who	has	never	made	girl	group	proposed	this	idea	to	the	big	record	labels	and	all	of	them	turned	this	idea	down
they	said	this	idea	would	not	work
however	the	idea	originator	goes	on	with	this	project	because	they	dont	think	making	big	girl	group	would	end	up	as	disaster
what	do	these	examples	tell	us
they	scream	that	if	we	put	people	without	direct	experience	to	do	the	job	we	are	deemed	to	get	something	fresh	and	thats	where	we	overcome	the	old	experiences	knowledge	awareness	of	not	knowing	the	heart	of	the	change	is	an	acceptance	that	we	do	not	know
when	we	are	aware	that	we	do	not	know	everything	will	start	to	change
thana	mentioned	about	not	knowing	that	we	will	turn	into	kodak	or	nokia	if	we	think	that	we	know
in	the	new	method	not	knowing	is	good	thing
knowing	is	such	hassle
we	have	to	be	aware	that	we	dont	know
this	is	the	most	important	thing	because	right	now	we	dont	know	the	customers
there	is	so	much	that	we	dont	know	because	of	the	drastic	change	in	consumer	behavior	of	customers	in	this	era
for	hotel	business	they	sell	moments
guests	will	remember	the	experience	in	moments	not	in	long	stretch	of	memory
people	will	remember	types	of	experience	which	are	peak	and	end
for	example	disneyland
if	we	do	customer	survey	of	their	experience	on	disneyland	each	moment	is	not	very	positive
the	ticket	is	hard	to	book
its	expensive	and	the	queue	is	insane
but	why	do	people	still	like	to	go	to	disneyland
the	answer	is	because	disneyland	creates	peak	moment	like	snapshots	with	the	cute	mascots	and	ending	moment	when	fireworks	are	lit	which	send	visitors	back	home	with	blast	of	happiness
therefore	designing	memorable	moments	for	the	hotel	is	the	challenge	empathy	key	to	gen	now	empathy	is	an	important	word	to	win	customers
thana	explained	the	meaning	of	empathy	in	very	interesting	way	that	what	does	empathy	mean
it	means	putting	yourself	in	anothers	shoes
why	is	it	important
its	because	the	world	is	changing
for	us	to	create	differentiation	for	our	business	we	need	to	have	the	empathy	to	know	what	the	customers	want
empathy	brings	about	innovation
to	be	able	to	empathize	we	have	to	start	from	pain	and	we	can	think	about	how	to	ease	that	pain
an	example	would	be	clinic	in	phitsanulok	that	examines	cervical	cancer	for	free	but	nobody	came	for	the	examination
the	doctor	had	empathy	with	the	patients
patients	must	feel	embarrassed	to	come	for	the	test
so	the	doctor	provides	masks	for	both	patients	and	the	doctor	to	wear
the	result	came	out	that	many	people	come	for	an	examination	right	after
this	is	to	think	from	the	customers	perspective	thana	also	said	that	data	will	have	to	be	used	together	with	empathy	to	get	the	best	result
for	example	in	japan	thought	about	what	to	sell	on	the	same	shelf	as	stockings
from	guts	feeling	most	people	would	think	women	products	should	be	placed	there
however	looking	at	the	data	there	were	many	female	customers	in	the	morning
but	right	after	pm	to	pm	there	were	more	male	customers	as	they	ran	an	errand	for	their	wives
thus	from	to	pm	will	place	fridge	of	beers	next	to	the	stockings	shelf
the	result	came	out	that	their	sales	increased
this	is	an	example	of	using	data	together	with	empathy	to	build	experience	and	boost	sales	hippo	an	obstacle	to	change	when	there	is	need	to	change	and	it	is	time	to	win	the	customers	heart	but	there	is	still	obstacle	to	overcome	and	that	obstacle	is	hippo
so	what	is	hippo
thana	suggested	the	method	to	handle	hippo	that	hippo	highest	paid	persons	opinion	is	the	person	with	the	highest	power	the	manager	business	owner	or	parents
the	way	to	deal	with	hippo	is	to	bring	hippo	out	for	walk	and	meet	customers
meeting	with	people	who	dont	know	arnold	schwarzenegger	or	chen	long
making	them	realise	that	they	dont	know
when	they	feel	that	theres	so	much	they	dont	know	this	feeling	will	make	their	confidence	crumbles	and	hippo	will	shrink	in	the	end	who	should	change
when	it	is	time	to	change	the	question	would	be	who	should	change	first
thana	shared	his	thought	that	when	went	to	the	discussion	panel	young	generation	people	would	say	that	they	want	their	parents	to	listen	to	this
people	of	the	older	generation	would	say	they	want	their	children	to	listen	to	this
so	who	should	change
would	say	we	should	change	ourselves	first
dont	think	about	changing	others
we	can	take	an	initiative	to	meet	customers	and	listen	to	them	more
however	the	majority	would	jump	to	the	conclusion	that	everybody	has	to	change
an	organization	should	change
boss	should	change
an	employee	should	change
we	have	to	start	from	being	small	hippo	and	change	our	attitude
be	humble	and	we	can	have	empathy
be	aware	that	we	dont	know
these	are	the	tips	to	bring	change	and	create	innovation
after	that	everything	will	move	on	their	own	tips	to	do	business	in	the	disruption	era	are	to	change	dna	upside	down	lean	the	organization	win	the	heart	of	the	gen	now	with	empathy	and	these	are	the	ultimate	moves	that	will	allow	businesses	to	survive	sustainably
elevate	business	services	to	the	next	level
new	digital	banking	platform	to	enhance	the	financial	experience	for	business	customers
health	trends	are	not	just	things	that	stay	current
but	the	trend	will	remain	strong	for	long	time
if	human	beings	want	good	health	and	long	life
when	it	comes	to	the	wellness	business	we	might	think	of	business	related	to	health	body	exercise
but	at	present	the	wellness	business	group	has	expanded	its	scope	in	many	ways
scb	sme	together	with	nstda	organized	seminar	to	open	perspectives	to	adapt	and	prepare	for	business	opportunities	in	smart	wellness
to	adjust	the	concept	create	point	of	sale	and	add	value	to	products	and	services
including	aggressive	market	expansion

to	share	experiences	from	cosmeceuticals	with	sme	entrepreneurs	who	are	doing	wellness	business	and	look	for	opportunities	from	innovations	to	create	new	business	opportunities
open	the	path	to	an	innovative	business	from	pain	point	is	the	beginning	of	the	natural	herbal	extract	business
khun	pinit	khueansuwong	managing	director	of	idea	expert	co	ltd	said	that	with	career	working	as	researcher	for	long	time
when	having	the	first	child	and	wanting	to	breastfeed	but	the	wife	does	not	have	milk	it	is	the	origin	of	starting	business	of	herbal	extracts	from	trigonella	foenum	graecum
khun	pinit	further	said	that	his	wife	had	searched	on	the	internet	until	she	found	medicinal	herb	that	is	useful	to	increase	milk
therefore	she	studied	and	tried	it	on	hir	wife
when	it	worked	well	she	gave	it	to	her	friends	and	became	starting	point	for	business
khun	pinit	said	that	starting	any	business	often	comes	from	seeing	an	opportunity
but	businesses	must	be	different
but	being	different	alone	is	not	enough	must	have	an	advantage	as	well
in	addition	there	must	be	mindset	to	do	business	to	create	market	not	compete	for	the	market
for	example	apple	iphone	built	the	first	mobile	phone	with	touch	screen
people	said	it	impossible	but	if	you	have	an	innovative	business	mindset	like	steve	jobs	they	ll	tell	you	to	always	ask	your	customers	what	they	want
customers	will	tell	the	opposite
for	example	saying	that	you	want	drill	but	want	hole
therefore	having	mindset	to	do	business	to	create	market	will	keep	your	ideas	from	being	blocked
because	we	are	going	to	do	business	with	new	products	and	services	that	have	never	been	seen	before
so	don	have	to	look	at	the	price	set	because	we	are	the	market	builders
by	doing	innovative	business	we	will	be	the	first	players	to	enter	new	markets	we	will	have	opportunities	we	will	have	new	ideas
for	example	doing	the	skin	care	business	everyone	says	that	it	is	the	red	ocean	market
but	we	create	innovation	therefore	every	innovation	is	every	change	and	change	always	has	friction
so	what	does	an	innovative	business	have	to	do	when	it	comes	to	penetrating	the	red	ocean	market
khun	pinit	told	about	expanding	the	herbal	succulents	from	breast	milk	supplement	products	to	extending	them	to	skin	care	products	that	penetrate	the	market	with	blue	dot	in	the	red	ocean	market	there	is	small	blue	dot	that	we	can	penetrate	the	market
starting	from	the	same	customer	base	to	try	it	out	namely	postpartum	mothers	who	want	to	be	as	beautiful	as	before	having	children	but	don	dare	to	use	products	sold	in	the	market	because	they	are	worried	about	chemicals	during	breastfeeding
when	customers	try	it	they	are	convinced	of	their	safety	and	confidence	in	herbs
make	it	easy	to	educate	market
then	expand	the	market	to	the	aging	society	group	sensitive	skin	group
in	addition	doing	business	in	scientific	way
every	product	must	have	scientific	evidence	that	can	prove	the	results	of	the	experiment
share	barriers	to	bringing	research	to	develop	into	new	products	khun	pinit	mentioned	that	there	is	one	obstacle	that	we	have	in	common	no	matter	where	the	research	is	taken
an	important	stage	to	push	research	into	international	products
khun	pinit	shared	his	experience	of	expanding	from	the	domestic	market	to	the	international	market
examples	of	herbal	supplements	for	breast	milk	market	size	in	the	country	compared	to	years	ago	has	continued	to	decline
because	the	birth	rate	of	thai	children	is	reduced	to	hundred	thousand	per	year
make	it	interested	in	expanding	into	foreign	markets	such	as	vietnam	cambodia	indonesia
the	method	of	selling	innovative	products	to	foreign	markets	should	consist	of	important	points
the	trend	of	doing	wellness	business	in	the	future	khun	pinit	views	that	there	will	be	trends	in	health	business	in	the	future	as	follows	doing	business	in	an	innovative	way	only	entrepreneurs	have	only	one	idea	unable	to	succeed
but	relying	on	government	support	to	help	drive	innovation	or	ideas	into	reality	plays	key	role	especially	the	national	science	and	technology	development	agency	of	nstda
this	is	like	the	main	cog	in	driving	innovation	in	thailand	and	helping	entrepreneurs	with	ideas	but	lacking	the	knowledge	to	conduct	scientific	research
khun	waleewan	ekanai	senior	research	assistant	nano	encapsulation	research	group	nanotechnology	research	team	for	quality	of	life	and	cosmetic	medicine	nanotechnology	center	nstda
has	mentioned	the	important	role	of	nstda	that	the	national	science	and	technology	development	agency	is	ready	to	support	innovation	for	entrepreneurs	who	want	to	extend	their	knowledge	to	innovation
by	focusing	on	pushing	for	innovations	that	can	be	used	in	real	life
because	there	is	team	of	researchers	who	are	experts	in	various	fields	in	the	introduction	of	nano	encapsulation	technology	used	to	make	innovative	herbal	products	nano	encapsulation	means	encapsulation	or	retention	of	important	substances	within	nanometer	sized	particles
nano	encapsulation	extending	thai	herbs	into	innovative	products	khun	waleewan	described	the	benefits	of	nano	encapsulation	technology	with	main	points	as	follows	how	do	sme	entrepreneurs	start	creating	innovative	products
khun	waleewan	said	it	important	to	start	working	with	researchers	to	find	balance	between	existing	technology	and	practicality
it	requires	cooperation	between	the	research	department	and	the	entrepreneurial	team	that	will	have	to	work	together	until	the	product	comes	to	the	market	and	can	be	used	for	real
which	group	of	customers	who	use	the	service	with	there	are	two	groups	of	nstda
in	this	regard	if	entrepreneurs	who	are	interested	in	research	work	with	the	nstda	can	contact	the	nstda	call	center	at	email	brc	nstda	or	th
and	can	follow	information	on	business	tips	and	seminar	activities	that	will	be	useful	for	businesses	from	siam	commercial	bank	and	all	government	and	private	sector	partners	throughout	the	year

healthcare	business	is	business	sector	that	has	significant	growth	potential	and	investment
from	the	trend	that	the	world	is	entering	the	aging	society
the	way	of	life	in	the	big	cities	that	change	including	severe	epidemics	such	as	the	covid	virus
khun	thanapol	itthinidipak	vice	president	head	of	thailand	business	blackrock	inc	came	to	provide	detailed	knowledge	of	the	health	care	business	in	thailand	and	globally
with	investment	specialist	khun	sukit	udomsirikul	managing	director	of	research	siam	commercial	securities	company	limited	scbs	and	khun	sornchai	suneta	managing	director	chief	investment	office	siam	commercial	securities	co	ltd	participated	in	discussion	on	healthcare	business	investment	opportunities
overview	of	the	healthcare	business	in	thailand	and	other	countries	when	talking	about	investing	in	the	healthcare	business	in	thailand	most	people	are	familiar	with	the	private	hospital	business
which	is	the	only	healthcare	business	in	thailand	that	can	be	invested
but	when	looking	at	the	global	healthcare	business	picture	there	are	many	businesses	involved	in	this	industry
which	mr	thanapol	mentioned	about	the	global	healthcare	sector	divided	into	main	business	groups	service	sector	as	follows	group	namely	pharmaceutical	companies	which	produce	and	sells	drugs	divided	into	types	original	and	generic	group	is	the	study	of	organisms	for	use
such	as	gmo	plants	chromosome	modification	and	the	important	thing	is	the	production	of	various	vaccines
especially	now	that	over	million	patients	worldwide	and	the	world	are	waiting	for	the	vaccine	against	the	covid	virus
khun	thanapol	views	that	in	the	treatment	of	patients	with	covid	this	should	be	expected	to	have	vaccines
doctor	anthony	fauci	head	of	the	us	plague	center	said	that	the	vaccine	is	expected	to	be	produced	by	the	end	of	commercial	production	should	be	possible	in	the	second	half	of	from	the	current	situation	make	shares	in	the	group	healthcare	equipment	group	that	produces	medical	devices	divided	into	types
including	disposable	equipment	single	use	devices	such	as	syringes	syringes	rubber	gloves	etc	accounting	for	of	production
durable	medical	devices	patient	beds	wheelchairs	medical	devices	using	high	technology	diagnostic	tools	for
and	reagents	and	test	kits	for	laboratory	use	with	share
which	the	most	profitable	thing	is	durable	equipment	follow	with	the	disposable	style
and	diagnostic	reagents
companies	in	the	medical	device	business	group	such	as	abbott	medtronic	depuy	synthes	of	the	united	states	siemens	of	germany	etc
the	country	that	exports	the	most	medical	devices	in	the	world	is	germany	followed	by	the	united	states	japan	and	china	which	is	ranked	th
however	medical	devices	manufactured	by	china	will	be	just	tool	that	uses	moderate	technology	different	from	the	top	countries	that	produce	export	modern	tools	use	advanced	technology
in	thailand	most	exports	of	medical	devices	in	asean	most	of	them	are	disposable	devices
such	as	rubber	gloves	the	second	largest	exporter	in	the	world	because	we	have	lot	of	rubber	raw	materials
but	even	though	thailand	exports	most	medical	devices	in	asean	but	when	looking	at	the	details	the	manufacturing	company	is	foreign	company	that	uses	raw	materials	in	thailand	for	export	production
the	other	is	the	disposable	equipment	business	is	difficult	market
since	it	does	not	require	advanced	technology	anyone	can	come	in	to	do	it
the	brand	has	no	value	competes	at	price
customers	can	change	the	brand	at	any	time
healthcare	providers	group	is	private	hospitals
have	income	from	medicine	services	of	medical	personnel	lab	ray	examination	and	the	room
this	is	an	important	factor	in	the	hospital	business	competition	is	to	have	large	hospital	network
because	it	will	be	an	advantage	of	the	economy	of	scale	in	the	purchase	of	many	medical	devices	for	use	in	all	affiliates
including	the	potential	to	capture	high	middle	level	customer	base	both	domestic	and	abroad
merger	and	acquisition	are	therefore	key	strategy	in	the	hospital	business
if	it	is	small	hospital	must	have	expertise	in	such	areas	as	eye	hospitals	for	example
leading	hospitals	such	as	unitedhealth	group	teladoc	health	of	the	united	states	bdms	and	bumrungrad	international	in	thailand
healthcare	insuranceis	service	that	is	in	the	healthcare	industry	and	is	very	important	in	countries	like	the	united	states	where	medical	expenses	are	high
but	the	state	welfare	is	less	when	compared	to	other	developed	countries
the	state	medical	expenses	are	only	medicare	for	the	elderly	and	medicaid	for	low	income	people
most	of	the	rest	of	the	population	must	have	their	own	health	insurance
why	invest	in	healthcare	the	tendency	of	the	healthcare	business	to	grow	in	the	long	term	is	due	to	the	changing	structure	of	most	of	the	countries	that	are	entering	the	aging	society
it	is	estimated	that	in	billion	people	will	be	over	years	old	accounting	for	of	the	world	population	of	million	people
resulting	in	an	increasing	number	of	patients	the	illness	in	most	elderly	patients	is	chronic	disease	that	requires	continuous	medical	visits
such	as	pressure	diabetes	atherosclerosis	etc
in	addition	lifestyle	in	big	cities	is	cause	of	obesity	and	various	complications
another	reason	is	that	in	many	countries	the	state	has	better	managed	health	insurance	systems	when	the	system	is	good	when	people	get	sick	they	go	to	see	more	doctors
drug	use	also	increases	as	resulting	in	the	healthcare	business	to	grow
for	short	the	spread	of	the	virus	covid	makes	people	turn	to	health	care	more
although	the	healthcare	provider	business	may	be	sluggish	because	people	are	worried	about	not	wanting	to	go	to	the	hospital	together	with	enforcing	the	physical	distancing
but	in	the	medical	equipment	and	suppliers	segment	it	received	positive	results	from	the	need	for	medical	devices	such	as	respirators	and	disposable	equipment
in	the	business	of	biotechnology	the	share	price	of	modena	the	inventor	of	the	vaccine	has	increased	from	at	the	beginning	of	the	year
how	to	invest	in	the	healthcare	business	mr	thanapol	suggests	investing	in	the	healthcare	business	in	ways	investing	in	individual	shares	both	in	thailand	and	abroad
buy	mutual	funds	invest	in	the	healthcare	industry	managed	by	professionals
invest	in	etfs	exchange	traded	fund	index	funds	listed	on	the	stock	exchange
regarding	the	investment	in	healthcare	shares	in	thailand	khun	sukit	further	analyzed	that	although	the	hospital	shares	were	affected	by	the	covid	crisis	resulting	in	fewer	patients	visiting	the	doctor	at	the	hospital	and	the	foreign	patient	group	disappeared
however	telemedicine	technology	has	been	used	instead	and	this	situation	will	gradually	improve	when	the	number	of	people	infected	reduces
as	for	international	patients	they	must	wait	for	their	return	journey
bdms	is	the	th	largest	healthcare	group	in	the	world
the	proportion	of	foreign	patients	is	less	than	bh	with	foreign	patients
according	to	the	scbs	analysis	it	is	expected	that	businesses	affected	in	the	first	half	of	from	covid	will	begin	to	recover	in	the	second	half	of	the	year	and	the	operating	results	may	have	long	term	growth	potential
both	the	elderly	society	specialized	treatment	center	and	international	patient	growth	consult	doctor	via	video	call
vietnam	is	clmv	country	demonstrating	promising	economic	growth
it	is	huge	market	and	sixty	percent	of	vietnams	population	of	million	is	younger	than	years	old
that	generation	is	characterized	by	higher	purchasing	power	and	they	usually	live	in	urban	areas
with	the	country	main	population	being	in	their	youth	they	prefer	products	imported	from	abroad
in	addition	the	governments	policy	allowing	foreign	entrepreneurs	to	hold	ownership	of	businesses	in	vietnam	data	from	the	department	of	international	trade	promotion	ditp	has	made	the	vietnamese	market	even	more	appealing	to	outsiders
seeing	the	potential	foreign	franchises	are	competing	for	investment	especially	in	the	continually	expanding	food	and	beverage	segment
franchise	businesses	in	vietnam	can	be	divided	into	segments	food	and	beverage	dining	and	an	evolving	vietnamese	society	survey	by	marketing	consulting	firm	decision	lab	discovered	that	vietnamese	people	nowadays	prefer	dining	out	and	many	factors	influence	their	decisions	in	choosing	restaurant	including	traffic	atmosphere	good	service	that	reflects	the	image	of	the	restaurant	and	attracts	customers	to	visit	and	socialize	and	decorations	that	allow	customers	to	take	nice	photos	and	post	them	on	social	media
these	factors	seem	to	be	even	more	important	than	cleanliness	and	taste
vietnamese	people	also	enjoy	foreign	food	but	various	restaurants	will	adjust	the	taste	to	be	more	in	line	with	local	preferences
the	arrival	of	bubble	tea	in	vietnam	bubble	tea	originated	in	taiwan	and	with	its	pleasant	aroma	and	mellow	taste	it	soon	gained	popularity	in	many	countries	with	vietnam	being	no	exception
with	young	people	having	higher	purchasing	power	and	more	open	to	foreign	cultures	bubble	tea	is	already	favorite	among	teenagers	in	southeast	asia
it	has	therefore	not	been	difficult	for	many	famous	bubble	tea	brands	from	taiwan	to	dominate	the	vietnamese	youth	market	such	as	gong	cha	koi	the	royal	tea	the	alley	and	several	others
however	the	older	generation	sees	bubble	tea	consumption	as	sign	of	wasteful	spending	habits	due	to	its	relatively	high	price	of	usd	per	serving	very	expensive	when	compared	to	the	average	gdp	per	capita	in	of	usd	per	year
this	issue	reflects	the	age	gap	of	people	active	on	online	social	media	in	vietnam
coffee	way	of	life	for	vietnamese	people	coffee	is	way	of	life	for	the	vietnamese
they	have	been	involved	with	coffee	for	long	time	and	are	big	coffee	drinkers	drinking	several	cups	day	on	average
coffee	is	one	of	vietnam	economic	crops	ranking	second	only	to	brazil	as	the	worlds	largest	coffee	bean	exporter
coffee	grown	in	vietnam	is	mostly	robusta	known	for	its	relatively	high	concentration	of	caffeine	and	sweeter	and	more	intense	taste
the	most	popular	brands	are	local	franchises	such	as	trung	nguyen	coffee	and	highlands	coffee	where	many	international	coffee	brands	cannot	compete
however	these	brands	could	be	quite	lucrative	business	abroad	due	to	their	unique	taste	and	the	outstanding	quality	of	vietnamese	coffee	which	is	favored	by	coffee	lovers	around	the	world
convenience	stores	convenience	stores	for	the	convenience	of	city	dwellers	the	convenience	store	business	has	grown	impressively	in	vietnam	providing	variety	of	products	and	brands	for	shoppers
these	stores	offer	wide	selection	of	local	brands	and	imported	products
there	are	currently	several	major	convenience	store	franchises	in	vietnam	including	circle	family	mart	shop	go	vinmart	mini	stop	and	others	which	are	spreading	to	every	corner	of	large	cities	such	as	ho	chi	minh	city	and	hanoi
convenience	stores	support	the	expansion	of	the	middle	class	urban	society	and	the	younger	population
this	growth	provides	promising	investment	opportunity	for	convenience	store	franchises	of	various	nationalities	in	market	that	still	has	room	for	expansion
survey	by	the	office	of	overseas	trade	promotion	in	ho	chi	minh	city	revealed	that	many	well	known	thai	products	are	sold	in	convenience	stores	in	vietnam
beauty	beauty	businesses	thrive	in	vietnam
report	by	online	news	agency	vietnamnet	stated	that	the	removal	of	seven	cosmetic	products	from	the	tariff	line	has	brought	beauty	and	skincare	products	especially	from	south	korea	to	the	vietnamese	market	through	the	franchise	business	model
beauty	businesses	have	become	an	attractive	market	with	beauty	clinics	from	other	countries	already	investing	in	vietnam
tutoring	schools	education	is	worth	the	investment	survey	conducted	by	the	department	of	international	trade	promotion	revealed	that	the	vietnamese	population	increased	from	to	million	between	with	the	trend	continuing
most	of	the	vietnamese	population	is	of	school	age	and	the	nations	economy	is	growing
skill	development	is	therefore	essential	to	driving	the	economy	forward
the	government	sector	has	therefore	accelerated	the	development	of	education	to	cover	remote	areas	beyond	big	cities
the	programme	for	international	student	assessment	pisa	is	program	to	measure	reading	science	and	mathematics
it	discovered	that	in	vietnam	ranked	among	the	top	countries	in	the	east	asia	and	pacific	region
pisa	assessment	also	showed	that	vietnam	ranked	higher	than	the	average	of	oecd	countries	organization	for	economic	co	operation	and	development	which	is	an	economic	organization	with	members	from	developed	countries	committed	todemocracyand	themarket	economy
vietnamese	parents	prefer	to	send	their	children	to	private	schools	believing	that	government	courses	are	too	stressful	obsolete	and	inflexible	while	forcing	students	to	take	more	hours	of	supplementary	courses
on	the	other	hand	with	less	intensive	studying	time	private	school	students	can	have	more	time	to	take	courses	at	tutoring	schools	after	school	and	on	holidays
in	addition	private	schools	offer	effective	teaching	of	english	better	meeting	working	life	demands
however	public	schools	are	still	popular	among	low	income	parents	and	high	school	students	preparing	for	higher	education
by	understanding	the	curricula	used	in	vietnam	local	tutoring	franchises	seem	to	better	meet	market	demands
in	addition	vietnamese	people	are	keen	on	developing	other	skills	apart	from	work
these	people	may	take	short	training	courses	for	life	skills	such	as	arts	sports	or	music
these	courses	aim	to	empower	their	physical	and	mental	well	being	for	better	life	experience
the	challenge	of	franchising	is	to	maintain	quality	control
the	solution	is	to	have	master	franchises	co	invest	with	local	entrepreneurs	to	help	strengthen	the	business

the	coming	of	covid	that	has	changed	all	aspects	of	human	life	from	onwards
causing	marketers	to	ponder	the	marketing	strategy	in	situation	that	has	never	happened	before
marketing	in	the	business	world	after	the	covid	how	to	change
khun	siwat	chaowariyawong	ceo	of	group	the	leading	agency	in	the	industry	who	is	behind	the	strategy	of	advertising	and	marketing	of	many	businesses	and	brands	in	every	industry	comes	to	share	experiences	in	adjusting	the	strategy	to	help	the	company	survive	from	the	crisis	and	the	future	from	now	on
changed	from	offline	to	online	as	major	agency	in	the	advertising	industry	in	in	of	the	billion	baht	in	advertising	budgets	for	businesses	in	thailand	are	under	group	this	is	money	spent	on	digital	media	with	the	top	business	sectors	spending	the	highest	advertising	budgets	including	motor	vehicles	skincare	finance	banking	food	and	beverages
in	the	opinion	of	khun	siwat	the	ranking	of	the	business	sector	that	has	been	spending	on	advertising	media	has	not	changed	because	they	re	all	big	businesses
but	what	has	changed	is	that	the	advertising	model	will	adapt	to	the	current	situation
such	as	the	automotive	business	that	is	attached	to	restriction	cannot	organize	motor	show	that	must	be	an	offline	event
must	switch	to	digital	media	primarily
such	as	searching	because	people	search	for	cars	indicating	that	there	is	demand	in	the	market
or	if	looking	to	find	old	customers	use	digital	media	to	find	old	customers
in	the	case	that	the	customer	has	not	yet	bought	use	data	collection	remarketing	approach	to	interest	customers
which	these	forms	occur	in	many	businesses	as	high	involvement	products
most	people	will	find	information	to	make	purchase	decision
in	which	the	digital	channel	is	the	answer	that	reaches	the	customers	the	best
consumer	behavior	change	change	marketing	strategy	for	the	main	skincare	products	the	company	will	use	advertisements	to	be	shown	on	youtube
this	is	not	an	important	point	because	however	consumers	must	use	skincare
but	what	changed	is	the	sales	channel	because	during	the	locked	down	period	the	mall	is	closed	customers	need	to	buy	via	commerce
customers	can	experience	new	way	of	buying
when	the	mall	is	back	to	normal	opening	there	may	be	some	customers	who	don	go	back	to	buy	offline	again
therefore	it	is	an	opportunity	for	marketers	to	use	the	customer	information	obtained	from	online	sales	to	create	retargeting	strategies	to	shoot	advertisements	for	target	customers	or	former	customers	familiar	with	the	product	rather	than	pulling	new	customers	from	other	brands
likewise	in	the	daily	use	of	goods	groceries	which	before	consumers	rarely	buy	groceries	online
but	during	the	lockdown	must	be	ordered	online	when	the	mall	is	open	some	groups	may	still	buy	online	while	some	want	to	go	back	to	the	mall
marketers	must	look	to	see	which	customers	are	in	which	group
what	is	the	proportion
and	then	do	marketing	to	customers	correctly
adjust	strategy	to	find	place	in	the	customer	mind	for	the	food	beverage	product	group	divided	into	the	products	in	the	freezer	are	shelves	that	people	still	must	eat	regularly
there	are	sales	channels	via	minimarts	convenience	stores	that	are	not	closed	during	the	lockdown	period	and	can	be	sold	online
the	impact	was	the	group	sent	to	the	restaurant
when	cannot	eat	at	the	restaurant	and	must	change	to	delivery
this	product	group	must	adjust	to	bind	to	the	restaurant	delivery	instead
restaurant	business	during	the	locked	down	period	that	the	shop	must	be	closed	and	changed	to	sale	via	delivery
which	stores	that	already	have	prominent	features	such	as	street	food	and	delivery	already	are	also	selling	better
but	if	the	shop	has	distinctive	feature	at	the	service	then	need	to	adjust	more	because	the	sale	of	the	delivery	cannot	deliver	the	service	that	is	the	selling	point	of	the	shop
only	food	can	be	sent
what	many	stores	do	is	organize	special	sales	promotions
updated	to	lunch	box	sales	or	new	menus	suitable	for	delivery
even	in	the	case	of	restaurants	that	focus	on	delivery	services	such	as	kfc	they	still	must	adjust	their	work	procedures	to	deliver	in	time	with	more	orders
and	when	people	change	to	cook	at	home	the	marketing	team	has	to	adjust	the	communication	strategy	to	use	what	kfc	chicken	can	cook	at	home
or	some	stores	use	vouchers	to	give	customers	cash	in	first
and	there	is	diy	food	such	as	snacks	tokyo	confectionery	selling	ingredients	for	customers	to	make	at	home
is	very	popular	because	customers	feel	fun	in	cooking
if	it	japanese	restaurant	like	omakase	chef	table	that	sells	chef	experience	come	to	cook	it	fresh
there	is	temporary	closed	or	change	to	sell	box	set
but	it	not	popular	because	the	experience	is	not	like	eating	at	the	restaurant
some	stores	even	launch	new	menus
because	the	store	reputation	is	strong	point	for	customers	to	trust	in	the	quality	and	ready	to	order
some	shops	send	chefs	to	make	customers	eat	at	home	for	example
all	this	concludes	that	marketers	must	work	hard	all	the	time	to	adapt
adjust	the	strategy	to	fit	the	needs	and	find	place	in	the	customer	mind
in	the	fashion	business	normally	customers	like	to	go	to	buy	clothes	at	the	store	because	they	can	try	on	the	dresses	as	well
but	because	of	covid	causing	customer	behavior	to	change
any	store	that	sells	via	commerce	then	improve	online	channels	to	get	more	customers
but	if	any	stores	that	primarily	sell	in	front	of	the	store	must	stop	slowing	down	some	even	if	wanting	to	sell	online	but	was	not	prepared	on	this	channel	before	so	changed	in	time
or	some	stores	will	change	to	new	products	such	as	changing	to	selling	fabric	masks	etc
in	this	regard	operators	must	mainly	look	at	customer	demand	and	adjust	in	that	direction
during	the	time	that	covid	has	quite	lot	of	comfortable	clothes	to	wear	is	trend	for	casual	work	clothes
can	be	worn	at	home	and	can	wear	to	work
covid	reduced	brand	loyalty	it	has	been	observed	that	the	covid	situation	has	reduced	consumers	brand	loyalty
khun	siwat	said	that	even	though	covid	causes	consumers	to	delay	spending	because	of	decreasing	incomes
but	there	are	still	groups	of	consumers	who	can	still	spend	on	their	own	happiness
in	the	past	offline	shopping	in	the	mall	has	to	walk	back	and	forth	resulting	in	limited	buying	options
but	during	the	lockdown	period	consumers	are	left	with	only	one	channel	which	is	online	shopping	which	can	click	to	see	all	brands	of	products	at	the	fingertips
so	it	easy	for	consumers	to	have	lot	of	time	to	explore	compare	products	by	brand
combined	with	the	data	being	reviewed	branded	content	as	well	as	discounts	and	promotions
and	then	have	free	time	to	look	at	that	information
therefore	having	the	opportunity	for	consumers	to	be	interested	in	trying	out	new	brands	and	easily	change	product	brands
technology	is	fight	for	survival
there	is	question	about	the	condition	that	people	do	not	really	touch	the	product	before	buying
what	is	the	heart	of	bringing	awareness	to	creating	engagement
khun	siwat	suggests	that	many	brands	of	businesses	use	technology	such	as	real	estate
use	video	to	deliver	experience
or	products	that	want	to	experience	the	real	thing	use	live	to	help
which	is	considered	technology	as	tool	that	humans	use	to	fight	to	save	themselves	and	their	businesses
for	products	that	focus	on	functional	engagement	that	requires	lot	of	information	aside	from	using	technology	to	help	still	use	the	limited	time	offer	promotion	to	help	customers	speed	up	buying	decisions
although	the	communication	business	normally	uses	lot	of	advertising	budgets	and	is	business	that	benefits	from	the	need	for	people	to	communicate	especially	mobile	devices
the	internet	signal	has	clear	increase	in	demand
but	for	mobile	devices	will	find	the	question	of	whether	to	use	the	same	item	first	or	buy	new	one
in	general	consumers	do	not	have	lot	of	money	to	buy	new	device
businesses	also	solve	the	situation	by	installments
as	for	the	advertising	spending	the	new	model	has	been	slowed	down	especially	for	products	that	should	already	be	selling	well
then	do	not	need	lot	of	advertising
effective	marketing	make	better	profits	in	finance	and	banking	khun	siwat	said	that	from	now	on	it	important	to	see	how	people	financial	behavior	will	change
both	spending	personal	finances	are	tied	to	the	need	for	money	the	need	for	credit	in	which	direction	it	will	go
and	the	other	side	is	the	level	of	investment	power	at	which	level	which	seems	to	be	reduced	like	other	businesses	the	demand	is	decreasing
the	strategy	to	be	solved	is	to	divide	the	various	segments	in	order	to	penetrate	to	find	customers	more	precisely
fortunately	digital	marketing	tools	already	can	communicate	with	customers	accurately
whether	the	organization	will	approach	customers	more	accurately	or	not	depends	on	the	use	of	data
including	the	ability	to	use	various	platforms	combined	with	the	combination	of	information	and	marketing	strategy	features	that	will	do
in	which	each	organization	is	not	equal	in	skill	whoever	is	better	segmentation	is	shot
advertise	to	customers	precisely
optimized	strategy	on	the	way
will	have	the	highest	sales	volume
and	have	money	left	to	do	other	promotions	resulting	in	lot	of	profit	margin
whoever	does	this	is	not	good	at	profit	margin
aviation	tourism	hotel	business	skill	development	marketing	waiting	for	revival	for	aviation	and	tourism	businesses	in	situation	that	cannot	be	chosen
like	the	domestic	aviation	business	still	has	chance	but	flying	abroad	quite	difficult	due	to	reduced	demand
because	traveling	to	foreign	conference	doesn	need	to	go	any	more	conference	technology	can	be	done	via	zoom
and	the	company	must	save	on	travel	expenses
as	for	tourism	people	have	less	money	must	save	cut	this	part	of	the	expense
will	return	to	the	olden	days	that	had	to	be	wealthy	person	to	be	able	to	travel	abroad
however	low	cost	airlines	is	still	available	as	an	alternative	to	consumers
the	hotel	business	was	heavily	affected	by	covid
because	of	foreign	tourists	that	is	the	main	customer	group	disappeared
combined	with	tourism	being	the	main	engine	of	the	thai	economy
some	hotels	must	temporarily	close	or	reduce	the	size	and	save	on	cost
for	hotels	that	are	not	large	then	changed	to	sell	restaurant	hotel	service
even	though	it	was	time	to	stop	waiting	for	the	situation	to	improve	in	digital	marketing	if	there	are	still	people	searching	for	hotels	such	as	thai	customers	meaning	that	there	is	still	need	for	hotel	rooms
therefore	being	an	opportunity	to	market	with	this	group	of	customers
another	way	is	marketing	with	old	customers
which	if	any	hotel	already	has	an	existing	customer	information	system	can	use	various	online	marketing	strategies	with	existing	customers	such	as	offering	special	discounts	shooting	ads	etc
has	an	advantage	over	hotels	that	never	collect	customer	data
in	addition	the	thai	hotel	business	must	prepare	to	accept	foreign	tourists
with	the	thai	reputation	of	managing	covid	effectively	we	have	better	reputation	elsewhere
but	must	develop	marketing	capabilities	as	well	because	when	tourism	is	opened	in	thailand	we	must	compete	with	other	countries
so	it	important	how	to	get	customers	to	get	value	improved	experience	to	attract	tourists	to	come
digital	media	platform	that	responds	to	the	market	after	covid	according	to	khun	siwat	digital	media	platforms	that	are	suitable	for	marketing	ahead	must	have	the	ability	to	measure	and	link	to	sales
an	accurate	target	audience	can	be	linked	to	existing	business	information	that	reflects	the	demand	for	the	product
and	the	flexibility	for	marketers	to	customize	their	communication	styles	as	for	the	question	of	whether	it	time	to	use	marketing	automation	technology
khun	siwat	views	that	large	organizations	have	been	preparing	to	do	this	for	long	time
and	if	doing	well	when	covid	passed	away	these	companies	will	have	huge	advantage
because	this	type	of	media	has	more	roles	than	other	media
as	for	which	you	haven	done	yet	the	decision	may	encounter	investment	restrictions	and	the	budget	is	more	limited
however	it	is	necessary	to	invest	because	this	technology	is	necessary	weapon	for	marketing	that	is	happening	today
depending	on	the	company	products	as	well
the	company	with	wide	range	of	products	there	are	many	groups	of	customers
should	invest	in	this	technology
more	than	companies	that	sell	only	products	and	have	only	one	customer	group	which	if	invested	more	than	necessary	will	become	an	elephant	riding	to	catch	the	hornet	therefore	the	decision	must	be	considered	based	on	many	factors
regarding	personnel	marketers	in	the	organization	themselves	must	understand	customers	more
the	agency	must	do	homework	on	the	product	more	distribution	channels	including	understanding	technology	advertising	platform	to	be	able	to	fully	utilize
because	the	method	of	acquiring	the	customers	of	each	business	has	different	strategies	therefore	must	find	strategy	that	is	suitable	for	that	product	category
khun	siwat	concluded	that	the	importance	of	each	business	is	not	only	competing	in	the	country	but	also	compete	with	businesses	or	products	that	are	from	foreign	countries	as	well
it	will	therefore	be	very	important	for	businesses	to	improve	themselves	to	compete	with	foreign	countries	entering	the	thai	market
invest	easily	with	the	scb	easy	app
if	talking	about	spa	years	ago	thai	people	may	not	be	very	familiar
but	when	fate	gave	flight	attendants	the	opportunity	to	use	spa	in	switzerland	they	were	inspired	to	build	their	own	spa	business
the	opportunity	came	when	the	old	door	closed	the	airline	running	bankruptcy	was	lay	off
new	door	opened	to	the	founder	of	divana	spa
with	the	intention	of	creating	unique	experience	while	highlighting	the	unique	scent	of	divana
until	it	is	recognized	and	has	become	the	destination	of	foreign	tourists	visiting	thailand	along	with	an	award	guaranteed	for	best	medical	spa	in	asia	for	consecutive	years
but	then	when	there	was	coronavirus	crisis	spa	which	had	been	fully	booked	throughout	the	year	had	to	close	branches	must	reduce	staff	salaries	and	the	main	foreign	customers	are	gone
what	is	divana	solution
khun	apiradee	hiranramadej	khun	rose	director	of	divana	wellness	co	ltd	shared	her	experience	of	transforming	the	organization	online	adapting	strategies	for	marketing	transformation	with	re	principles	covid	is	the	opening	of	new	door	again
rose	said	that	the	crisis	felt	insurmountable	because	every	crisis	had	grown	and	this	time	was	the	same
if	possible	the	business	will	be	able	to	expand	its	customer	base	endlessly
allowing	everyone	in	the	company	from	executives	to	employees	to	work	together	to	overcome	obstacles	and	learn	together
divana	has	found	solution	by	adjusting	its	online	strategy	to	move	forward	with	sustainability
normally	reception	staff	only	have	the	duty	to	welcome	customers	not	having	to	go	out	to	them	because	in	the	past	foreign	customers	have	booked	online	or	via	the	agency	has	never	had	to	market	online
in	this	crisis	divana	had	to	adapt	to	cope	with	this	change	by	using	the	six	principles	of	online	marketing	as	follows	and	of	course	when	there	is	change	there	will	be	friction
rose	said	some	of	the	employees	might	not	be	able	to	accept	it	which	is	normal
therefore	it	is	essential	to	find	the	right	people	to	fill	the	organization
for	divana	take	advantage	of	management	trainee	by	recruiting	new	generations	to	join	them	to	lead	to	faster	change
the	staff	of	this	team	are	responsible	for	the	project	and	present	it	once	week
therefore	always	generating	new	business	ideas	and	creating	talent	environmental	to	happen	within	the	company	as	well	create	cool	ideas	to	create	items	that	meet	the	needs	of	covid	in	addition	the	spa	was	closed	affiliated	businesses	were	also	affected
for	example	spa	products	when	the	hotel	closes	the	product	cannot	be	delivered	to	the	hotel
clinic	and	caf	with	thai	customers	but	the	shop	in	the	mall	was	closed	by	default
in	conclusion	there	is	no	business	that	generates	any	income
but	what	divana	did	was	find	solution	by	brainstorming	ideas
rose	said	that	the	youngster	in	the	team	got	on	the	train	and	had	crush	on	the	idea	that	there	was	alcohol	left	in	the	warehouse	we	should	try	making	an	alcohol	spray	selling	it	online
it	turned	out	that	sales	reached	million	baht
that	meant	that	online	channels	that	had	never	been	used	in	the	past	were	powerful	and	employees	started	to	have	online	skills
if	you	look	at	it	from	another	angle	it	also	allows	employees	to	propose	new	ideas	which	is	another	way	to	drive	the	company	forward
rose	also	said	that	covid	showed	the	spirit	of	all	employees
during	that	time	the	company	gave	off	work	and	paid	half	the	salary
when	the	company	plans	to	adjust	to	online	sales	by	targeting	to	sell	products	in	stock	unit	per	week	and	contract	with	the	team	if	they	help	each	other	to	sell	according	to	the	target	everyone	will	receive	full	salary
when	the	project	was	notified	it	turned	out	that	the	employees	were	very	enthusiastic	to	sell
while	the	reception	that	originally	did	not	have	to	do	sell	they	are	diligent	to	sell	via	line	oa	and	slept	at	am	in	the	hope	that	if	the	sales	meet	the	target	everyone	in	the	company	will	receive	full	salary	which	can	be	achieved
plus	some	people	also	get	more	incentives	who	earn	more	than	their	regular	salary
it	is	also	launching	new	line	of	dietary	supplements	like	vitamin	which	is	getting	very	positive	feedback	from	online	sales	as	well
and	online	sales	also	show	management	that	there	is	talent	in	the	company
it	helps	to	know	which	employee	should	become	the	branch	manager	and	which	is	the	person	who	generates	income	for	the	branch
joining	all	platforms	to	boost	sales	power	when	divana	is	used	online	as	marketing	tool	the	main	platform	of	choice	is	line	oa	because	it	can	interact	with	customers
sell	and	tag	what	products	the	customer	is	from
with	lead	from	social	media	such	as	when	customers	see	facebook	ads	they	will	link	to	line	oa
the	salesperson	will	answer	customer	questions	and	close	the	sale
in	addition	commerce	such	as	lazada	and	shopee	is	also	used	in	the	livestream	because	commerce	has	the	strength	of	an	algorithm	that	can	bring	customers	to	see	lot	of	live	making	it	possible	to	use	both	commerce	and	social	media	every	time
together	to	stand	up	to	the	audience
and	collaborated	with	scb	shop	deal	ais	and	eventpop	platforms	to	sell	vouchers	to	expand	the	customer	base	to	more	thais
divana	is	currently	in	the	process	of	doing	seo	to	attract	more	customers	to	the	website	because	it	sees	the	website	as	the	company	digital	asset	and	the	best	customer	database	without	having	to	rely	on	any	external	platforms
go	live	awakens	the	courage	to	try	new	things	rose	said	that	when	there	was	staff	member	to	sell	online
so	the	management	team	started	making	an	example	by	playing	tiktok
when	employees	see	it	they	know	the	direction	of	the	company	in	the	future
which	the	first	live	broadcast	employees	may	still	be	embarrassed	to	act	but	when	they	do	it	more	often	they	gradually	develop	from	viewers
poor	now	there	are	thousands
rose	gave	an	example	of	an	employee	named	pluto	that	at	first	said	couldn	speak	well	couldn	do	it
rose	therefore	encouraged	to	put	the	clip	into	chula	market	place	it	turned	out	that	there	were	hundreds	of	people	commenting	on	pluto	to	make	her	more	confident
until	now	pluto	has	become	divana	star	influencer
promote	live	enhances	strengths	resolves	weaknesses	when	using	online	platforms	we	can	see	marketing	potential	in	new	dimensions
in	particular	the	live	purpose	is	build	relationship	with	customers	customer	engagement	make	customers	trust	and	confidence	in	products	and	services	customer	trust	able	to	reach	target	customers	target	reach	and	rose	also	sees	that	live	can	also	help	with	pain	point
for	example	sukhumvit	soi	branch	is	located	in	deep	soi
as	usual	when	coming	customers	will	get	off	at	bts	nana	and	there	will	be	tuk	tuk	from	the	spa	and	if	they	are	thai	customer	they	will	drive	by	themselves	but	often	cannot	find	the	shop
therefore	gave	nong	pluto	live	how	to	get	to	the	spa
clearly	see	services	or	points	of	interest	makes	customers	wanting	to	come	to	the	service	which	is	better	than	seeing	with	pictures
rose	also	said	that	adding	individuality	to	product	or	service	is	equally	important
at	divana	we	have	different	signature	programs	for	each	club	to	attract	customers
and	when	influencers	are	hired	to	help	promote	branches	each	branch	will	have	different	strengths
makes	it	possible	to	increase	program	sales	continuously
including	the	decoration	of	the	place	to	have	beautiful	highlight	because	most	people	like	to	take	pictures	and	share	them	via	social	media	will	help	to	create	awareness	for	the	brand	in	another	way
for	live	selling	techniques	are	as	follows	set	target	customer	study	your	customers	who	they	are	what	age	they	are	what	are	they	interested	in	so	that	they	can	choose	the	appropriate	topic	or	issue	and	find	the	point	of	sale	that	best	meets	their	needs
equipment	good	quality	of	live	comes	from	having	the	right	equipment
if	the	live	has	started	and	the	sound	is	low	it	doesn	sound	clear
spotty	and	choppy	images	causing	the	need	to	open	new	live	before	calling	people	to	come	and	see	is	not	easy	therefore	you	need	to	have	tools	and	equipment	ready	such	as	pocket	wi	fi	insert	sim	card	high	speed	internet	or	have	good	microphone	for	clear	sound	script	the	script	will	determine	the	way	to	live
even	though	it	is	live	broadcast	every	chapter	must	be	given	direction	including	visualizing	the	composition	of	the	story	since	its	release
create	peaks	and	close	live	etc
activity	product	showcase	what	is	the	preparation	of	products	or	services	that	you	want	to	promote	such	as	what	is	the	product	to	sell	must	show	demonstrate	to	see	sale	find	points	of	sale	that	make	customers	interested
ready	to	figure	out	how	to	close	powerful	deal	live	atmosphere	successful	lives	tend	to	be	fun	colorful	not	boring	natural	and	there	should	be	the	energy	team	as	their	soulmate	to	support	and	cheer	during	the	lively	lives	such	as	bang	hasan	my	wife	wants	to	eat	shrimp	must	eat	shrimp	think	about	activities	to	increase	engagement	during	live	such	as	asking	liking	sharing	get	discount	or	organizing	live	sharing	team	in	marketplace	or	facebook	group	with	many	members
live	engagement	should	see	the	chat	periodically
if	customers	say	hello	they	should	say	hello	to	make	them	feel	important
announcement	to	call	guests	or	viewers	through	social	media	hours	in	advance	before	leaving	rose	also	said	that	during	the	live	broadcast	the	name	should	be	named	live
organize	promotions	and	should	not	live	more	than	minutes	because	people	will	be	bored
including	before	the	live	you	should	study	how	other	people	do	each	other	and	find	examples	of	the	live	people	that	you	like	and	then	adjust	them	to	the	personality	of	the	live	person	it	will	be	simple	method	at	the	beginning	of	the	selling	live

there	is	checklist	for	starting	startup
lets	see	what	you	should	remind	yourself	of	for	smooth	business	conduction
this	article	shows	what	qualification	shall	leaders	have	to	bring	the	business	to	reach	the	goal	how	to	deliver	experience	and	prepare	for	the	next	fundraising
having	growth	mindset	attitude	in	this	digital	disruption	era	anything	could	happen
also	those	skills	and	knowledge	in	the	past	may	no	longer	be	needed	anymore
hence	growth	mindset	is	the	most	important	attitude	for	startup	management	because	they	need	to	be	ready	to	change	be	flexible	and	see	through	the	problem	with	new	solution	to	reach	the	goal
having	open	minded	attitude	since	most	startup	models	are	original	startup	leaders	must	have	vision	with	big	picture	of	what	ideal	team	they	want	to	work	with	and	what	they	shall	do	to	reach	the	goal
while	leaders	are	looking	at	the	big	picture	and	building	inspiration	to	the	team	small	pictures	from	the	team	and	the	others	are	also	important	in	order	to	develop	the	ideal	business	model	to	come	true
having	marketer	attitude	although	there	might	be	many	startup	founders	with	different	positions	whether	developer	or	designer	however	the	most	necessary	personality	in	the	startup	leader	team	is	the	marketer
even	though	how	strong	the	backend	developer	is	or	how	good	the	design	is	but	the	startup	is	not	well	known	among	people	discussing	and	inviting	investors	to	invest	in	their	startup	will	be	difficult
founders	especially	the	ceo	must	own	the	marketer	personality	and	know	how	to	promote	their	startup	products	or	services	to	be	recognized	by	the	targeted	group
also	being	able	to	exchange	opinions	of	their	area	and	introduce	their	startup	to	the	public	is	needed	when	they	meet	new	people
having	team	management	skill	there	is	always	presentation	to	the	committees	and	investors	about	team	at	every	startup	pitching	competition	because	both	internal	team	relationships	and	founders	relationship	is	one	of	the	important	indicators	that	show	how	possible	the	success	of	that	startup	can	be
many	startups	could	not	reach	the	goal	because	broken	team	and	they	separated	before	reaching	the	target
hence	relationship	management	whether	founders	talented	persons	and	bringing	the	whole	team	to	the	same	goal	is	valuable
having	ambition	rome	was	not	built	in	days	thus	the	new	startup	model	is	also	cannot	be	successful	in	days
regarding	startups	is	something	that	has	never	existed	before	so	changing	the	market	and	consumers	behaviors	together	with	persuading	investors	to	invest	is	not	that	easy
good	startup	leaders	shall	own	an	ambitious	personality	to	reach	their	goal
being	rule	breaker	startup	is	like	creator	who	understands	the	marketing	trends	and	original	behavior	but	is	also	ready	to	create	new	trend	instead	of	following	those	old	ones
good	startup	leaders	shall	not	be	afraid	of	any	obstacle	and	be	ready	to	destroy	it	in	order	to	create	new	path
it	may	be	impossible	that	everyone	will	have	those	capabilities	from	the	beginning	but	if	you	are	interested	in	starting	startup	but	lack	of	any	above	mentioned	ability	you	still	have	chance	to	learn	and	improve	yourself
we	believe	that	if	you	are	willing	to	do	it	you	can	be	good	startup	leader	as	well

phd	virot	dr	ta	managing	director	of	skooldio	and	former	data	scientist	at	facebook	will	tell	us	about	the	importance	of	data	collection	and	usage	for	smes	to	go	right	to	the	heart	of	the	customers	and	win	them	over
data	collection	starting	point	to	help	in	remembering	customers	dr	ta	shared	with	us	that	in	reality	business	people	or	entrepreneurs	normally	use	data	but	most	people	do	not	notice
for	example	if	we	are	the	owner	of	the	coffee	shop	how	do	we	take	care	of	our	customers
we	might	greet	the	customer	good	morning
is	it	usual	for	you	we	can	recommend	drinks	and	dishes	to	them	or	one	of	the	regulars	has	disappeared	and	when	they	have	returned	we	know	that	we	should	especially	pamper	them	and	give	complimentary	snacks	to	them	so	that	they	will	come	again
the	question	is	how	do	we	know	what	to	do
the	answer	is	simply	because	we	have	all	the	data	that	helps	us	to	remember	our	customers
when	we	know	them	we	can	guess	what	is	in	their	mind
all	that	said	is	the	result	of	the	data	remembered	by	the	human	brain	but	in	this	digital	era	computers	can	be	used	to	memorize	information	or	collect	customer	information
this	allows	us	to	remember	know	what	they	like	and	take	care	of	our	customers	effectively
dr	ta	suggested	smes	to	start	collecting	their	own	information	as	followed	if	there	is	website	for	the	business	all	data	can	be	collected	regardless	of	which	page	customers	go	which	button	customers	press	and	how	long	do	they	spend	on	the	page
this	information	can	be	collected	or	sometimes	helper	like	google	analytic	or	facebook	will	be	useful	as	customer	information	tracker
more	importantly	we	have	to	be	able	to	ask	ourselves	of	what	is	the	information	that	we	need	and	collect	that	information	as	detailed	as	possible
if	business	does	not	have	their	own	digital	platform	but	make	use	of	other	online	platforms	in	which	each	platform	has	different	strengths	it	is	recommended	that	the	business	uses	all	platforms	and	should	not	be	selective
the	platforms	are	such	as	facebook	line	shop	lazada	etc
these	platforms	also	allow	backdoor	downloading	but	we	have	to	be	careful	about	the	product	details
the	name	or	code	of	the	same	product	should	be	uniform	on	all	platforms	because	if	the	name	or	code	is	different	the	collection	of	information	will	be	difficult
we	could	be	confused	if	the	products	are	the	same	or	not
then	we	can	proceed	on	consolidating	all	information	in	excel	sheets
we	can	now	see	information	see	signs	that	we	can	develop	or	plan	the	product	management	effectively
if	business	keeps	information	on	paper	let	us	start	by	putting	information	like	sales	into	excel	sheets	or	pos	system	to	collect	information	digitally
know	the	insight	and	understand	customers	with	data	when	the	computer	is	used	to	help	in	storing	information	in	business	to	remember	customers	the	next	step	would	be	to	read	their	minds
dr	ta	recommended	easy	methods	which	are	to	look	at	the	feedback	from	the	customers
for	example	if	business	has	facebook	page	we	should	have	look	at	the	analytic	to	see	how	customers	respond	to	the	content	published	see	the	engagement	how	many	reaches	how	many	active	users	there	are	and	what	is	the	time	frame	that	has	the	most	users
this	is	so	that	the	business	knows	the	situation	knows	the	problems	and	sees	an	opportunity	that	could	happen
facebook	is	the	platform	that	gives	all	the	information	that	we	do	not	have	to	go	through	the	hassles	and	process	information	ourselves
we	just	have	to	start	by	looking	at	the	information	in	our	hands
by	seeing	the	information	in	front	of	us	it	is	the	beginning	of	the	business	to	try	to	read	customers	minds
then	comes	the	action	to	do	something	out	of	the	information	and	this	causes	future	development	from	the	information
collect	every	data	to	see	the	relationship	dr	ta	said	that	data	analysis	is	the	seeing	information	in	various	aspects	such	as	which	platform	can	sell	the	most	products	or	which	menu	is	the	best	seller	by	summarising	all	the	information	to	see	the	relationship	or	to	compare	and	the	processed	information	should	be	changed	from	tables	to	graphs	for	easy	understanding
apart	from	business	information	that	owners	should	collect	by	themselves	we	should	also	heed	the	sound	of	the	market
dr	ta	suggested	that	the	business	look	for	trends	by	searching	google	to	have	look	at	what	people	are	recently	searching
for	example	online	courses
most	people	will	always	search	for	free	online	courses	or	online	courses	with	certificates
these	searches	will	allow	businesses	to	know	what	people	want	deep	down	in	their	hearts	and	what	they	are	looking	for
the	business	will	need	to	have	their	eyes	on	the	market	and	analyze	what	they	see
if	we	want	to	guess	what	customers	need	or	what	they	are	thinking	we	will	need	ai	to	help	in	prediction
we	will	then	start	to	understand	and	be	able	to	read	customers	minds
as	for	personalization	the	collection	of	individual	customer	information	will	have	to	be	accomplished	first
for	an	instant	mobile	number	or	customer	code	has	to	be	collected	in	order	to	remember	the	past	activities	of	the	customers	and	know	the	date	that	the	transaction	happened
only	then	that	personalization	can	take	place
how	digital	technology	helps	business	to	get	to	the	heart	of	the	customers	when	business	remembers	and	understands	customers	the	next	step	is	to	win	customers	hearts
let	us	take	an	example	from	the	journey	of	the	general	customers
customers	access	the	website	and	add	the	item	into	the	basket
some	get	in	and	go	out	without	buying	anything
some	bought	the	items	and	come	back	as	return	customers
when	the	customer	information	is	remembered	and	customers	desire	is	known	the	next	move	that	business	should	take	is	to	look	for	customers
customers	who	added	items	into	their	basket	of	course	are	interested	in	the	product	but	how	to	find	them
in	facebook	there	is	function	called	custom	audience
its	purpose	is	to	hunt	for	those	customers
simply	whenever	we	want	to	buy	something	the	advertisements	will	appear	in	every	digital	platform	we	go	to	about	weeks	long	or	if	customers	still	do	not	buy	products	we	will	have	to	think	further	of	the	problems
is	the	price	too	high
we	might	have	to	re	target	to	tell	customers	that	the	item	that	they	are	interested	is	now	on	sale	and	they	should	get	their	hands	on	the	item	or	customers	open	food	delivery	application	and	still	do	not	order
they	open	another	food	delivery	application	to	compare	the	price
instantly	they	receive	an	sms	from	the	first	food	delivery	application	saying	that	the	first	kilometres	of	delivery	is	free	of	charge	to	attract	customers	back	to	the	first	application
another	example	is	that	customers	bought	the	mobile	phone	and	how	to	make	them	return	and	buy	another
businesspeople	could	try	to	recommend	related	products	to	the	customers	such	as	charger	or	phone	case
this	is	the	thing	that	businesses	should	do	in	the	digital	era
dr	ta	said	that	we	can	see	that	in	the	digital	world	entrepreneurs	can	collect	information	and	do	many	things	with	it
how	to	remember	customer	information
how	to	analyze	information	and	read	the	customers	minds
lastly	how	to	use	online	platforms	to	hunt	down	customers
before	we	go	dr	ta	left	us	some	words
he	said	want	you	to	try	collecting	data	with	your	business
everything	about	data	might	sound	difficult	but	it	is	not	difficult	to	start
with	data	you	can	do	business	in	the	digital	world	faster
you	will	start	to	use	computers	and	robots	so	you	can	take	care	of	our	customers	better
you	will	certainly	know	your	customers	better	and	surely	take	care	of	them	better
citation	digital	sme	conference	thailand	unlocking	the	power	of	data	in	business	by	ph	virot	dr	ta	managing	director	of	skooldio	and	former	data	scientist	at	facebook	on	september	for	sme
many	restaurants	have	been	unable	to	stay	in	business	in	the	wake	of	the	covid	pandemic	which	has	lasted	almost	two	years	now
however	some	establishments	have	still	managed	to	profit	and	expand
this	article	explores	how	two	restaurant	operators	addressed	the	challenges	their	restaurants	faced	managed	their	shops	and	developed	products	to	increase	sales	during	downward	trend
siruwat	chatchaval	chief	commercial	officer	thai	brand	zen	corporation	the	operator	of	zen	and	aka	japanese	restaurants	and	parin	suksmith	the	founder	of	phoenix	lava	and	curry	of	the	caribbean	will	share	with	us	their	secret	tips	for	success	in	winning	customers	hearts	and	getting	away	from	the	crisis	unscathed
first	step	into	the	restaurant	business	siruwat	first	worked	as	creative	in	the	advertising	business	for	while	and	later	wanted	to	start	my	own	business
when	opened	my	first	restaurant	selling	somtum	and	san	food	rarely	applied	much	creativity	to	my	business	instead	focusing	on	business	concepts
for	restaurants	food	quality	must	be	the	priority	to	convince	customers	to	keep	coming	back
but	restaurant	owners	must	oversee	restaurants	overall	operations	and	not	just	make	good	food
fortunately	my	background	in	advertising	allowed	me	to	adopt	marketing	approaches	to	boost	my	business
as	an	owner	who	didnt	know	much	about	cooking	my	main	task	was	to	control	profit	and	loss	sales	customer	service	food	quality	and	consistency
needed	to	know	how	to	set	appropriate	pricing	communicate	with	customers	maintain	staff	and	collect	data	on	meals	based	on	customer	satisfaction	and	comments	to	improve	our	food	quality	and	customer	services
these	are	all	important	skills	for	restaurant	owners
parin	had	wanted	to	start	business	since	my	college	days
explored	my	preferences	and	searched	for	the	right	opportunity
both	my	brother	and	have	always	enjoyed	eating	desserts	and	snacks	so	one	day	he	asked	me	to	start	food	business
thought	about	it	for	about	six	or	seven	months	while	working	in	japan
started	with	single	product	lava	pao
at	that	time	the	lava	pao	trend	was	very	strong	and	it	occurred	to	me	that	salapao	steamed	buns	was	product	that	people	would	buy	repeatedly	for	different	occasions	and	festivals
it	is	also	easy	to	eat	with	steamed	buns	being	equivalent	to	japanese	onigiri	or	hamburgers
nowadays	half	of	our	store	sales	come	from	lava	pao
when	we	started	we	struggled	lot
we	opened	branches	both	in	thailand	and	overseas	and	later	had	to	close	many	branches
finally	learned	that	food	business	should	offer	more	variety	so	that	customers	can	come	back	every	day
following	the	closures	we	launched	new	business	model	with	branches	currently	open	in	thailand
coping	with	covid	siruwat	the	zen	group	has	been	greatly	impacted	with	sales	down	roughly	by	because	most	of	our	locations	are	in	department	stores
delivery	has	made	up	for	about	of	our	previous	sales
however	in	the	wake	of	the	crisis	the	groups	khiang	brand	has	stayed	strong	with	sales	at	our	branches	rarely	affected	by	the	covid
we	have	shifted	from	restaurant	business	to	food	service	selling	retail	ingredient	sales	raw	materials	and	franchising
this	adjustment	has	allowed	us	to	grow	steadily
when	the	pandemic	arrived	we	had	to	find	new	way	to	do	business
we	couldnt	just	open	restaurants	in	shopping	malls
now	we	try	open	new	branches	per	month	because	in	the	long	term	they	will	be	profitable
we	can	continue	opening	more	branches	because	we	understand	the	behavior	of	thai	people
with	the	lockdown	many	people	may	think	that	delivery	is	the	final	solution
people	can	always	buy	food	from	nearby	shops
shop	owners	can	also	avoid	the	gp	because	if	you	set	cheaper	price	you	cant	afford	to	pay	the	gp	fee
the	expansion	of	khiang	brings	two	benefits	profit	to	operations	and	more	options	for	customers
if	we	understand	the	market	we	will	know	where	to	open	shop	optimal	pricing	and	how	much	investment	will	be	needed	to	get	going
during	downturn	we	can	still	generate	income
for	every	crisis	there	will	always	be	hero	and	khiang	is	that	hero	for	the	zen	group
one	product
we	had	to	adjust	our	strategies	by	starting	delivery	service	using	motorcycle	taxis	to	deliver	our	lava	pao
at	that	time	couldn	figure	out	which	model	would	be	most	suitable	for	our	business	so	we	just	made	adjustments	from	time	to	time
to	our	surprise	we	found	that	our	sales	increased	once	the	pandemic	arrived
one	of	the	reasons	is	because	our	business	model	had	been	redesigned	to	be	grab	go	bakery	where	customers	dont	spend	much	time	at	the	shop	and	just	pick	up	take	home	orders
that	turned	out	to	be	perfect	for	the	covid	era
in	addition	the	franchise	business	has	seen	growth	during	the	pandemic
previously	there	were	only	two	shops	operating	under	the	franchise
therefore	we	adjusted	the	model	to	continue	with	both	franchises	and	our	own	shops
sales	have	increased	particularly	during	the	outbreak
beginning	in	october	last	year	we	began	focusing	on	promoting	franchises	and	now	we	are	trying	to	expand	by	one	franchise	store	per	month
products	improvement	to	boost	sales	siruwat	would	like	to	raise	an	example	from	our	aka	buffet	restaurant	chain
we	introduced	gyudon	menu	but	sales	did	not	come	close	to	pre	covid	levels
also	at	tummour	we	found	that	somtum	must	be	served	fresh	so	delivery	was	not	the	answer
so	we	decided	to	introduce	bottled	jaew	bong	luang	prabang	chili	and	pickled	fish	for	those	making	somtum	at	home
brand	owners	should	first	understand	who	their	customers	are	and	whether	the	food	they	serve	is	suitable	for	delivery
some	brands	like	khiang	are	made	for	delivery
therefore	we	take	them	out	of	restaurants	to	save	rental	costs	and	delivery	riders	can	park	their	motorcycles	right	in	front	of	the	shop	making	delivery	faster	and	cheaper
both	buyers	and	sellers	are	happy
the	more	khiang	shops	the	closer	they	are	to	customers
khiang	has	also	launched	buy	one	get	one	thep	moo	menu	promotion	to	further	increase	its	popularity
why	choose	best	seller	menu	for	promotion
because	we	focus	on	what	our	customers	want
we	want	our	campaign	to	get	win	win	results	from	customers
this	is	an	outside	in	concept
we	may	not	make	that	much	profit	but	we	must	make	sure	that	our	customers	are	happy	not	just	eliminate	old	stock
we	need	to	use	our	data	to	come	up	with	strategies	to	turn	crisis	into	an	opportunity
during	this	difficult	period	we	must	also	share	with	society
customers	will	accept	us	if	we	support	each	other	to	survive
solving	problems	in	times	of	crisis	must	be	done	carefully	and	shouldnt	just	rely	on	trends
we	must	analyze	our	business	and	how	long	the	crisis	will	last	to	decide	whether	we	should	stay	put	or	create	new	brands	or	new	products
developing	new	product	takes	long	planning	and	if	it	cant	be	launched	in	time	we	may	waste	time	and	money
the	covid	situation	looks	like	it	will	continue	for	long	time	so	the	restaurant	business	must	adopt	mix	of	solutions	for	success
in	search	of	an	existing	hero	product	for	better	sales	parin	think	delivery	platforms	can	solve	pain	points	for	restaurants	concerning	delivery
however	it	is	brands	duty	to	ensure	that	customers	will	place	repeat	orders
focus	on	digital	marketing	so	that	customers	can	click	to	order	on	the	platform	during	the	required	period
for	example	when	robinhood	offers	free	delivery	the	team	will	try	to	create	call	to	action	on	every	digital	platform	to	encourage	customers	to	click	the	desired	platform	and	identify	popular	delivery	platforms	in	each	area
however	we	must	do	our	best	before	hoping	that	delivery	platforms	will	promote	our	shops	because	we	dont	have	big	budget	to	boost	the	visibility	of	our	brand	on	delivery	platforms
it	is	important	to	spend	wisely	on	digital	marketing	or	use	facebook	groups	to	our	advantage
suriwat	for	me	expanding	khiang	branches	to	get	closer	to	customers	allows	them	to	eat	freshly	cooked	food	which	is	more	delicious	than	pre	made	food
therefore	location	is	the	key	to	success
khao	phad	kra	phrao	is	basic	meal	enjoyed	by	everyone
cant	rely	on	social	media	to	promote	my	product	so	choose	to	put	ads	on	billboards	for	increased	visibility	instead	of	spending	money	on	online	media
nice	billboards	in	good	locations	can	increase	brand	perception	as	well	as	social	media	buzz
first	we	must	analyze	factors	affecting	our	customers	decisions	such	as	pricing
the	grab	go	concept	allows	customers	to	pay	less	because	there	is	no	gp	fee
what	if	customers	dont	come	back
suriwat	no	one	wants	to	cook	or	dine	out	every	day	so	we	must	know	how	to	get	our	brand	to	stay	with	customers
for	example	we	want	them	to	think	of	khiang	when	they	want	to	eat	phad	kra	phrao
dont	be	afraid
we	must	understand	customers	and	be	their	friends
if	they	want	to	cook	buy	our	sauce
whenever	they	dont	want	to	wash	dishes	they	can	come	to	us
we	shouldnt	focus	on	business	alone	but	rather	stand	with	customers	during	this	difficult	period	so	we	can	grow	stronger	together
parin	think	that	customers	want	convenience
city	dwellers	dont	like	to	cook
the	ongoing	pandemic	is	good	time	to	explore	and	try	other	possibilities
for	example	having	ready	made	ingredients	that	customers	can	buy	for	cooking	at	home	is	good	option
however	my	phoenix	lava	may	not	suit	that	option	as	its	too	complicated	for	home	cooking
but	trying	new	alternatives	is	interesting
distribution	to	reach	more	consumers	parin	phoenix	lava	currently	has	branches
one	issue	we	are	dealing	with	is	how	to	make	customers	living	outside	the	city	buy	our	products	at	lower	price
during	the	covid	outbreak	most	newly	opened	branches	were	located	out	of	town	such	as	in	rangsit	salaya	or	nonthaburi
we	try	to	take	our	shops	closer	to	customers	and	let	them	order	from	their	nearest	location	to	save	on	delivery	costs
brands	must	minimize	investment	such	as	reducing	the	size	of	their	stores	to	provide	customers	with	the	lowest	possible	prices	while	keeping	food	quality	as	good	as	ever
suriwat	we	have	opened	more	branches	to	serve	customers
everyone	wants	more	convenience	at	lower	price
business	owners	have	to	make	good	decisions	on	setting	the	right	prices	during	this	situation	and	learn	what	kind	of	food	their	customers	want
products	must	accentuate	brand	character
during	crisis	we	need	to	find	out	how	to	offer	free	delivery
we	must	understand	the	situation	live	with	it	but	find	the	best	solution	for	customers	to	ensure	that	they	remember	our	brands
if	we	remain	in	our	customers	hearts	it	will	be	easier	to	compete	and	survive
how	can	you	make	restaurant	stronger
suriwat	cash	flow	and	cost	reduction	are	the	keys
owners	must	know	how	long	they	can	survive	with	the	money	in	their	pockets	or	how	many	employees	they	can	keep
once	we	know	our	expenses	we	need	to	calculate	our	income	to	see	whether	it	covers	expenses
then	we	must	decide	what	we	can	cut	to	survive	and	make	plans	for	several	possibilities	such	as	the	best	or	worst	scenarios
we	must	have	plans	ready	to	tackle	uncertainties
for	example	the	zen	group	has	learned	to	go	outside	shopping	malls	and	not	just	rely	on	delivery	alone
we	must	also	understand	consumer	behavior
previously	when	we	operated	full	dine	in	option	we	didnt	really	understand	how	delivery	could	work	for	us
but	with	covid	we	learned	more	about	our	customers
we	understand	that	customers	ordering	from	khiang	dont	want	to	wash	dishes	so	we	use	microwavable	cups	and	stronger	utensils	to	be	easier	for	use	with	meat
we	cut	the	marketing	budget	to	focus	more	on	the	quality	of	raw	materials	making	better	products
weve	learned	to	live	with	the	disease	and	not	just	wait	around	for	it	to	end
parin	talked	to	our	team	about	the	future	of	the	food	business
we	are	looking	ahead	and	found	that	some	models	are	not	practical	for	this	situation	such	as	full	service	caf
if	we	want	to	stay	in	the	food	business	for	long	time	we	must	choose	the	right	trend	and	adjust	from	opening	large	stores	to	smaller	ones
every	store	now	has	smaller	space	with	different	layout	to	cut	unnecessary	items	while	accommodating	quicker	sales
now	we	have	mix	between	grab	go	and	delivery
weve	experimented	with	new	models	too
for	example	going	with	other	brands	and	using	cloud	kitchens	to	maintain	volume	where	we	dont	have	branches
we	choose	the	best	practical	strategies	for	us	to	survive	while	making	our	costs	lower	choosing	the	right	models	to	offer	good	food	and	lower	delivery	costs
there	is	always	an	opportunity	in	every	crisis
its	up	to	us	to	spot	those	opportunities	so	that	we	can	survive
business	owners	must	truly	understand	their	customers	needs	to	adjust	their	strategies	and	not	just	follow	trends
every	brand	is	different	and	must	adapt	to	survive	and	not	just	wait	for	the	crisis	to	pass
several	plans	are	available	to	accommodate	any	situation	and	can	be	deployed	immediately
in	difficult	times	we	must	have	empathy	and	make	our	customers	priority	without	sacrificing	our	business
businesses	and	customers	must	survive	together

ep	from	the	article	learning	from	china	during	covid	pandemic	ep	chinese	life	on	coronavirus	lockdown	that	shows	the	direct	experience	from	the	chinese	business	expert
it	is	the	lesson	since	the	pre	covid	crisis	than	the	whole	country	lockdown	and	resulting	ing	chinese	behavior	changes
in	this	ep	manop	sangiambut	executive	vice	president	for	chinese	business	at	scb	and	thanamon	sutheerapak	business	relation	manager	at	scb	shanghai	branch	will	talk	about	the	government	measures	to	support	the	economy	and	how	is	the	opportunity	of	thailand	in	the	post	covid
also	how	to	apply	these	chinese	covid	lessons	in	other	situations
the	first	measure	from	the	government	to	alleviate	the	smes	while	the	crisis	happens	the	impact	on	small	businesses	is	the	most	powerful	likewise	in	china	where	the	economy	relies	on	smes	for	about
normally	sme	business	owners	have	cash	flow	less	than	months
hence	the	chinese	government	and	the	local	provincial	authorities	announced	the	measures	to	support	the	economy	and	the	mains	are	giving	the	support	money	to	increase	consumers	buying	power	via	electronic	wallet	issue	the	public	loaning	bond	for	lending	to	entrepreneurs	with	low	interest	rate	and	many	financial	measures	tax	measure	permission	requests	step	reduction
however	in	manops	opinion	he	thought	that	these	remedial	actions	compared	to	the	hamburger	crisis	are	not	the	urged	one	but	they	only	prolong	alleviate	and	stop	the	economy	bleeding
besides	the	powerful	means	are	coming	right	up	to	strengthen	and	maximize	the	economic	limit	in	this	dragon	land
the	most	powerful	medicine	is	the	mega	project	system	injection	as	the	chinese	way	always	finds	chances	during	any	crisis
once	the	hamburger	crisis	the	chinese	government	was	throwing	large	amount	of	money	to	build	the	fundamental	systems	which	were	the	high	speed	train	around	the	country	and	have	become	one	of	the	world	leaders	of	rail	technology	and	be	able	to	export	it	to	other	countries
likewise	for	this	covid	pandemic	china	is	planning	to	find	opportunities	to	expand	the	network	to	put	enormous	money	into	the	economy	and	maximize	the	country	ability
also	building	new	fundamental	system	is	one	of	their	plans	however	we	have	to	wait	for	the	government	policy	announcement
is	not	only	internet	speed	but	also	the	latest	information	transferring	that	can	build	personalized	customer	experience
so	every	chinese	business	must	adapt	itself	and	prepare	for	the	processes
then	ai	will	come	after	which	china	is	planning	to	be	the	leader	by	the	next	years	manop	said
thanamon	told	us	that	chinese	government	measures	are	so	effective	that	could	help	and	support	the	entrepreneurs	survival	whether	loan	marketing	and	taking	care	of	employee	temperature	screenings	to	ensure	customer	safety
moreover	the	government	also	gave	support	to	low	earning	citizens	such	as	lifting	the	support	measures	increasing	selling	rates	of	agricultural	products	and	elderly	support	money
online	businesses	have	been	dramatically	growing	up	in	every	country	during	the	covid	pandemic	as	also	in	china
most	chinese	people	are	already	familiar	with	online	shopping
thanamon	told	us	that	this	pandemic	caused	the	big	step	to	the	commerce	business	and	entrepreneurs	have	to	learn	online	marketing	to	reach	those	customers	and	the	first	come	is	the	first	serve
thai	business	opportunity	after	covid	as	there	is	an	opportunity	in	every	crisis	therefore	how	can	thai	entrepreneurs	find	these	opportunities
manop	told	us	that	the	first	opportunity	after	chinas	lockdown	easing	is	the	investment	from	china	since	the	fdi	of	few	previous	years	shows	that	chinese	investors	are	the	number	one	ranking	of	investors
so	we	expect	that	after	covid	and	trade	war	china	will	look	for	an	international	manufacturing	base	and	thailand	sits	in	the	center	of	southeast	asia	whether	in	the	terrain	and	international	investor	base
we	believe	that	money	from	china	will	be	increasing	because	they	intend	to	invest	and	find	opportunities	in	thailand
the	second	one	is	the	chinese	tourists
if	we	can	control	the	covid	situation	and	as	soon	as	we	can	get	back	to	normal	thailand	is	still	in	the	first	tourist	destination	for	chinese
so	thai	tourism	strategies	need	to	be	prepared	for	welcoming	chinese	standardize	the	sanitization	and	be	ready	for	the	new	norm	of	chinese	behavior
the	third	one	is	selling	thai	goods	opportunities	in	china
we	are	good	at	agricultural	products	and	processed	food	so	this	is	one	of	the	best	opportunities	to	expand	an	online	business	because	the	chinese	consumer	number	is	growing
also	thai	is	good	at	health	business	therefore	thai	entrepreneurs	should	find	more	opportunities	in	health	technology	which	has	become	more	popular	and	got	support	from	the	chinese	government
manop	also	said	that	apart	from	food	export	to	china	thai	entrepreneurs	should	study	the	chinese	consumer	behavior	who	tend	to	buy	online	international	goods	such	as	mom	and	child	products	fashion	goods	or	daily	essential	goods	etc
this	is	the	opportunity	for	thai	companies	to	find	favorable	circumstances	from	this	crisis
learning	from	the	dragon	land	what	have	we	learned	from	the	covid	pandemic	in	china
thanamon	told	us	that	most	chinese	people	found	no	difficulty	even	though	they	have	to	stay	home	and	did	not	get	paid	because	there	is	saving	culture	in	china	society	from	generation	to	generation
thus	the	crisis	happened	chinese	people	were	not	affected	or	lacked	emergency	money
also	chinas	fundamental	groundworks	are	ready	whether	cashless	society	development	alipay	technology	tracking	wechat	pay	and	also	effective	government	support	measures
also	chinese	people	have	the	fighting	nature	in	every	crisis
meanwhile	manop	told	us	that	china	will	become	the	leader	of	the	world	in	every	aspect	after	the	covid	pandemic
so	thai	companies	should	follow	up	chinas	market	because	china	will	become	the	super	macro	influencer	and	affect	every	thai	business
since	china	is	the	first	encounter	of	the	covid	pandemic	which	made	the	whole	world	find	them	as	strong	country	that	can	deal	with	adversity	by	the	effective	and	strong	leader	to	rebuild	the	economic	system	therefore	china	is	already	known	as	the	next	world	economic	leader
so	thai	people	should	learn	from	them	whether	in	the	business	adaptation	to	be	ready	for	the	new	normal	and	also	their	saving	discipline	their	fighting	habit	as	they	will	get	up	no	matter	how	difficult	they	face
the	chinese	dragon	is	always	back	to	the	sky

by	angwara	chaianong	the	business	collateral	law	is	tool	to	increase	an	opportunity	for	entrepreneurs	to	use	economic	assets	as	collateral	in	order	to	reach	the	source	of	funds	easily	and	to	be	able	to	ask	for	various	types	of	loans	especially	medium	entrepreneurs	or	smes
for	example	when	sme	wants	to	request	financial	loan	and	contact	collateral	like	commercial	bank	the	bank	will	consider	assets	that	entrepreneurs	use	as	collateral	and	will	process	loan	agreement	and	registration	for	the	business	collateral	contract	with	the	department	of	business	development	after	that	sme	will	get	loan	to	run	the	business
what	is	business	collateral	law
how	important	is	it
why	shouldnt	medium	entrepreneurs	or	smes	overlook	that	law
you	may	study	some	essential	information	below
the	business	collateral	contract	is	law	legislated	for	supporting	entrepreneurs	to	use	economic	assets	as	collateral	for	financial	loan	without	handing	over	possession	to	creditors
assets	used	for	business	collateral	are	the	following	economic	assets
business	is	an	asset	which	guarantor	uses	for	running	the	business	such	as	land	building	and	car
legal	claim	is	right	to	receive	payment	regardless	of	whether	it	is	cash	or	other	assets
chattel	is	real	estate	that	the	guarantor	uses	for	running	the	business	such	as	machine	inventory	or	raw	materials	used	for	product	manufacturing
immovable	property	in	the	case	that	guarantor	runs	immovable	property	business	directly	such	as	real	estate	building	housing	estate	or	allocating	vacant	land	the	guarantor	can	use	real	estate	or	building	for	collateral
intellectual	property	includes	copyright	patent	trademark	and	trade	secret	etc
the	business	collateral	contract	must	be	made	by	letter	and	registration	only
however	the	guarantor	can	either	hold	the	status	of	an	ordinary	person	or	juristic	person	and	has	the	right	to	use	assets	considered	collateral	and	must	prepare	the	property	accounting	to	be	verified	by	bank	or	securities	finance	company	or	insurance	company
all	those	institutions	are	responsible	for	business	collateral	registration	at	the	department	of	business	development	ministry	of	commerce	and	have	the	right	to	accept	debt	from	collateral	before	other	creditors
compulsory	collateral	can	be	made	in	two	types	compulsory	property	collateral	and	compulsory	business	collateral
compulsory	property	collateral	creditors	can	sell	property	collateral	or	fall	the	property	collateral	into	their	own	right
for	example	debtor	has	overdue	debt	and	the	principle	exceeds	the	value	of	property	collateral	and	the	debtor	hasnt	paid	interest	for	five	years	without	collateral
if	the	institutions	enforce	collateral	by	notified	letter	they	do	not	have	the	right	to	distribute	and	transfer	collateral	assets	or	do	anything
compulsory	business	collateral	there	must	be	referee	who	is	approved	by	the	business	collateral	official
the	referee	must	have	expertise	in	law	accounting	economics	business	administration	or	property	appraisal	and	no	prohibited	characteristics	as	defined	by	law
this	referee	is	called	collateral	enforcer
when	there	is	case	for	collateral	enforcement	by	contract	collateral	institutions	will	issue	letter	to	the	collateral	enforcer
once	the	letter	is	received	the	collateral	enforcer	will	assign	date	time	and	venue	to	prove	the	facts	shortly	no	later	than	days	after	receiving	the	letter
the	institutions	are	prohibited	to	distribute	and	transfer	business	collateral	except	that	the	business	owns	fresh	or	spoiled	assets	such	as	agricultural	products	or	raw	materials	being	used	as	business	collateral
the	institutions	may	sell	property	collateral	and	take	money	to	pay	off	debt
the	collateral	contract	can	be	terminated	under	the	following	cases
the	insured	debt	has	expired	redemption	of	the	collateral	property	was	made	disposal	of	the	collateral	property	guarantor	and	collateral	institutions	make	an	agreement	letter	to	terminate	business	collateral	contract	in	summary	the	business	collateral	law	is	enforced	to	support	entrepreneurs	to	use	economic	assets	as	collateral	for	financial	loans	without	handing	over	possession	to	the	creditor
the	law	also	helps	reduce	collateral	conditions	creates	equality	for	entrepreneurs	to	reach	more	sources	of	funds	and	increases	an	opportunity	and	potential	for	entrepreneurs	to	get	appropriate	financial	costs

life	begins	after	being	fired	hi	lights	never	thought	of	being	company	owner
no	ambition	to	be	leader	and	is	not	good	at	taking	care	of	anyone
but	then	one	day	found	myself	sitting	in	beautiful	house	in	the	ekkamai	area	that	was	turned	into	an	office
along	with	mommam	the	lonely	little	dog	that	walks	around	the	conference	table	whimper	urging	to	play	all	the	time
fifteen	minutes	the	weekly	meeting	is	about	to	begin
opened	my	macbook	pro	good	laptop	that	has	changed	everything	in	just	years
things	happen	like	miracle
from	writers	who	had	never	had	bestseller	and	former	employees	who	had	been	fired
changed	myself	to	become	businessman	with	dream	and	carrying	more	responsibility	than	myself	once	thought	that	can	be	accepted	stories	from	now	until	the	next	episode	may	not	be	the	knowledge	for	development	or	inspiration	that	makes	someone	want	to	find	who	he	is	exactly
what	am	going	to	tell	from	this	story	is	the	story	of	hot	blooded	teenager	who	has	done	everything	from	zero
to	the	beginning	of	the	work	that	challenges	both	success	relationship	and	meaning	of	life	that	always	changes	along	the	way
as	an	entrepreneur	practitioner	and	personal	preference	in	the	intern	movie
will	record	these	stories	as	the	internpreneur
the	story	of	small	entrepreneur	who	started	the	company	to	friendship	farewell	and	struggling	to	find	the	meaning	of	life
the	first	story	that	want	to	tell	will	take	readers	back	to	the	beginning	that	made	my	life	come	to	this	point
believe	that	each	person	has	turning	point	in	life	perhaps	with	good	luck	or	perhaps	bad	luck	leading	to	good	things
but	for	me	this	is	not	luck	and	not	good	at	first
ultimately	this	important	event	is	pinning	and	let	me	start	my	life	with	new	milestone
the	meaning	is	different	from	the	original	and	it	grows	stronger
cannot	imagine	any	experience	that	can	benefit	me	like	this
if	think	about	the	words	to	make	it	easy	to	visualize	this	my	life	has	started	new	meaning	after	being	fired
the	afternoon	of	forgotten	year	and	month	got	off	the	bus	stops	before	my	usual	stop
wide	footpath	light	splashed	into	orange	opened	sky	view	the	empty	field	is	beautiful	but	my	heart	is	still	dull
one	big	tree	stands	out	lonely	stayed	still	without	any	meaning
have	plenty	of	time	to	stop	standing	and	looking	at	all	things	day	and	night
should	sell	shirts	called	it	tree	shirt	with	tree	pattern
there	is	no	clear	answer
confused
questioning	many	things	in	life
why	am	so	stupid
what	can	do	next
tearful	face	when	secretly	put	the	keys	in	the	office	in	the	morning	with	short	thank	you	message	on	piece	of	paper
used	to	be	writer	who	people	kept	eyes	on
wrote	column	and	pocket	book	at	an	early	age
my	life	goal	is	to	become	famous	writer	and	editor
until	one	day	was	approached	to	join	very	cool	magazine	team	in	the	literary	field
and	then	fell	from	that	point	all	events	are	clear	in	my	memory
was	in	the	office	with	my	boss	who	is	senior	writer	who	is	the	front	line	artist	of	the	country
before	realized	the	discontent	of	my	work	and	the	feud	became	more	intense	and	visible
have	suffered	from	my	life	there
but	think	can	fight	and	prove	myself	because	this	is	the	dream	and	the	goal
have	worked	with	person	that	see	as	model	of	life
get	great	reward	great	life	and	more	freedom	than	any	other	works	that	can	find
that	was	the	idea	at	that	time
khun	kathanyu	don	let	you	pass	the	probation	this	speech	was	flashing	during	my	struggle
was	stunned	my	heart	fell	and	broke
you	use	only	the	mouth	to	work
the	great	writer	gives	me	reasons
after	hearing	those	words	changed	was	angry	and	furious
it	was	terrible	pain	from	both	being	kicked	out	and	insulted	until	didn	know	where	to	hide	my	face
confessing	that	was	so	angry	that	wanted	to	punch	him	for	revenge
but	was	silent	not	saying	anything
don	use	emotions	with	me
the	great	writer	who	knows	the	minds	of	people	said
sat	still	kept	my	feeling
do	not	want	the	tears	of	shame	to	flow	in	front	of	him
from	the	person	loved	now	hate	him	at	the	heart
there	is	no	one	who	made	me	hate	this	much	before
hate	writers	and	hate	writings
the	boss	said	he	would	still	pay	this	month	salary	and	asked	me	to	find	new	job
was	certain	that	would	not	take	any	cent	from	him	and	will	go	out	to	find	my	own	way
the	next	day	was	confused	and	wondered	on	the	side	of	the	road	as	told
it	time	for	the	meeting
our	team	members	are	all	here
must	go	now
next	time	will	tell	you	about	my	life	after	being	fired	which	has	never	been	happened	before
the	results	in	the	bad	event	have	turned	to	the	way	have	not	expected
looking	back	to	you	might	be	so	curious	what	would	the	square	symbol	qr	code	or	quick	response	code	get	involved	with	our	daily	living
during	those	years	qr	cod	was	only	be	of	smart	phone	to	focus	on	newspaper	or	magazine	and	advertising	signs	to	instantly	get	information	from	linked	website	pictures	and	moving	pictures	without	touching	any	alphabet
at	that	time	we	were	all	impressed	by	its	ability	but	never	expected	it	would	influence	our	life	except	for	finding	more	friends	by	picture	taking	through	application	line
until	years	ago	in	china	that	qr	code	has	become	the	most	popular	matters	since	the	qr	code	signs	appear	in	front	of	all	shopping	places	namely	fresh	markets	food	centers	and	even	street	shops
mobile	payment	is	the	new	payment	route	for	china	towards	the	cashless	society
even	street	beggars	or	wanderers	and	musicians	also	attached	qr	code	signs	at	their	money	boxes	for	donation
all	of	these	happenings	have	been	driven	by	the	two	main	service	providers	namely	wechat	and	alipay
accordingly	in	payment	by	mobile	phone	in	china	was	as	high	as	only	us
or	approximately	ml
baht
well	just	only	that	much
if	wed	like	to	make	it	closer	to	our	thai	situations	in	the	convenient	store	seven	eleven	started	to	show	the	alipay	sign	to	communicate	with	more	than	million	chinese	tourists	to	easily	pay	by	their	mobile	phones	without	worrying	whether	they	had	cash	for	shopping
even	in	the	korean	popular	series	their	players	also	showed	qr	code	payment	for	shopping	the	sponsors	brand	of	such	series
it	looked	so	easy	that	we	felt	like	being	one	of	them
qr	code	is	thus	not	the	matter	unknown	among	thai	people
instead	it	has	totally	overturned	our	financial	world	by	its	easily	approach	of	cashless	to	persuade	the	new	generation	into	its	association
several	big	banks	have	started	invading	both	tv	and	online	campaigns	to	influence	business	owners	nationwide	both	big	and	small	enterprises	to	start	qr	code	services	attached	with	bank	accounts	id	card	number	or	mobile	phone	number	with	more	than	one	bank	under	certain	prompt	pay	rules	by	which	qr	code	sign	will	be	given	to	enhance	easy	payment	by	customers	into	either	the	saving	or	current	account
for	instance	the	money	solution	of	scb	the	system	that	helps	solving	problem	of	holding	bank	notes	of	smaller	value	for	required	changing
no	worry	anymore	if	the	cash	received	would	get	lost	since	everything	would	be	managed	by	the	set	system
according	to	the	buyers	perspective	this	system	is	as	easy	as	fingertips	role	as	an	explanation	for	qr	code	scanning	by	mobile	phone	to	transfer	money	for	online	shopping	wherever	it	is	at	the	fresh	market	weekend	market	canteen	coffee	shop	taxi	bus	or	even	for	motorcycle	riding
qr	code	benefits	also	include	better	financial	disciplinary	since	paying	through	mobile	phone	will	keep	reminding	us	that	its	your	own	money	for	which	you	would	be	more	careful	to	spend	the	future	money	by	credit	card
as	technology	is	now	serving	us	this	fingertip	convenience	then	weather	we	would	enter	the	new	financial	world	or	not	depending	on	both	sellers	and	buyers

scb	sme	together	with	nstda
organize	seminar	to	decode	to	open	perspectives	to	adapt	and	prepare	for	business	opportunities	in	smart	wellness	in	order	to	adjust	the	concept
create	point	of	sale	and	add	value	to	products	and	services
including	aggressive	market	expansion	ready	to	update	trends	in	cosmetic	medicine	technology	create	opportunities	for	product	research	and	development
with	mr	pinit	khueansuwong	managing	director	of	idea	expert	co	ltd	and	ms	waleewan	ekanai	senior	research	assistant
nano	encapsulation	research	group	nanotechnology	research	team	for	quality	of	life	and	cosmetic	medicine	nstda	nanotechnology	center	to	share	experiences	from	cosmetic	treatment	to	sme	entrepreneurs	who	are	doing	wellness	business	and	looking	for	opportunities	from	innovations	to	create	new	business	opportunities
open	the	path	to	an	innovative	business	from	pain	point	is	the	beginning	of	the	natural	herbal	extract	business
pinit	khueansuwong	managing	director	of	idea	expert	co	ltd	said	that	with	career	that	has	worked	as	researcher	for	long	time
when	he	had	his	first	child	and	wanted	to	breastfeed	his	mother	but	his	wife	didn	have	milk	that	was	the	reason	for	starting	business	of	herbal	extracts	from	betel	nut
pinit	further	said	that	his	wife	had	searched	the	internet	until	she	found	medicinal	herb	that	is	useful	to	increase	milk
therefore	she	studied	and	tried	it	on	her	wife
when	it	was	effective	she	gave	it	to	her	friends	and	became	starting	point	for	business
pinit	said	that	starting	any	business	often	comes	from	seeing	an	opportunity
but	businesses	have	to	be	different
but	being	different	alone	is	not	enough
must	have	an	advantage	in	addition	there	must	be	mindset	to	do	business	to	create	market	not	compete	for	the	market
for	example	apple	iphone	built	the	first	mobile	phone	with	touch	screen	system
people	say	it	impossible	but	if	there	is	an	innovative	business	mindset	like	steve	jobs	they	will	tell	you	to	think
always	ask	customers	what	they	want
customers	will	tell	the	opposite	for	example	they	want	drill	but	they	actually	want	holes	so	having	mindset	to	do	business	to	build	market	will	keep	their	ideas	from	getting	blocked
because	we	are	going	to	do	business	with	new	products	and	services	that	have	never	been	seen	before	so	don	have	to	look	at	the	price	set	because	we	are	the	market	builders
by	doing	innovative	business	we	will	be	the	first	players	to	enter	new	markets	we	will	have	opportunities	we	will	have	new	ideas
for	example	doing	skincare	business	everyone	says	it	the	red	ocean	market	but	we	create	innovations
therefore	every	innovation	is	every	change	and	change	have	friction
there	will	exactly	be	people	against	it	so	what	does	an	innovative	business	have	to	do	when	it	comes	to	entering	the	red	ocean	market
pinit	told	about	expanding	the	herbal	sap	from	breast	milk	supplement	products	to	extending	to	skincare	products	that	penetrate	the	market	with	blue	dot	in	the	red	ocean	market	there	will	be	small	blue	dot	that	we	can	penetrate	the	market
starting	from	the	same	customer	base	to	try	it	out	namely	postpartum	mothers	who	want	to	be	as	beautiful	as	before	having	children	but	don	dare	to	use	products	sold	in	the	market	because	they	are	worried	about	chemicals	during	breastfeeding
when	customers	try	it	they	are	convinced	of	the	safety	of	herbs
make	it	easy	to	educate	the	market	and	then	expand	the	market	to	the	aging	society	group	sensitive	skin	group
in	addition	doing	business	in	scientific	way
all	products	must	have	scientific	evidence	proving	their	results
the	barriers	to	bringing	research	to	develop	into	new	products	were	shared	as	follows
pinit	mentioned	that	there	is	one	obstacle	that	has	the	same	problem	no	matter	where	the	research	is	taken
important	stages	to	drive	research	to	international	products	pinit	shared	his	experience	of	expanding	from	the	domestic	market	to	the	international	market
examples	of	herbal	breast	milk	supplement	market	size	in	the	country	compared	to	years	ago	has	continued	to	decline
because	the	birth	rate	of	thai	children	is	reduced	to	hundred	thousand	per	year	representing	they	are	interested	in	expanding	into	foreign	markets	such	as	vietnam	cambodia	indonesia	by	selling	innovative	products	to	foreign	markets

unable	to	reach	the	land	of	dreams	but	relying	on	government	support	to	help	drive	innovation	or	ideas	into	reality	especially	the	national	science	and	technology	development	agency	or	nstda	which	is	like	the	main	cog	in	driving	innovation	in	thailand	and	helping	entrepreneurs	with	ideas	but	lacking	knowledge	in	scientific	research
ms	waleewan	ekanai	senior	research	assistant	nano	encapsulation	research	group	nanotechnology	research	team	for	quality	of	life	and	cosmetic	medicine	nanotechnology	center	nstda	has	mentioned	the	important	role	of	nstda	that	the	national	science	and	technology	development	agency
ready	to	support	innovation	for	entrepreneurs	who	want	to	extend	their	previous	knowledge	to	innovation
by	focusing	on	pushing	for	innovations	that	can	be	put	into	practice	because	there	is	team	of	researchers	who	are	experts	in	various	fields	in	the	introduction	of	nano	encapsulation	technology	used	to	make	innovative	herbal	products	nano	encapsulation	means	encapsulation	or	retention	of	important	substances	within	nanometer	sized	particles
nano	encapsulation	expanding	thai	herbs	into	innovative	products	waleewan	described	the	benefits	of	nano	encapsulation	technology	with	main	points	as	follows	how	do	sme	entrepreneurs	start	creating	innovative	products
waleewan	said	it	important	to	start	working	with	researchers	to	find	balance	between	existing	technology	and	practicality
which	requires	cooperation	between	the	research	department	and	the	entrepreneurial	team	to	work	together	until	the	product	comes	to	the	market	and	can	be	used	for	real	which	group	of	customers	who	use	the	service	with	there	are	two	groups	of	nstda

it	is	undeniable	that	the	covid	crisis	has	had	huge	impact	on	the	world
and	with	the	current	situation	it	still	impossible	to	predict	how	it	will	end
amid	the	uncertainty	ambiguity	and	not	knowing	when	consumers	will	feel	safe	enough	to	return	to	their	normal	lives
therefore	the	forecast	of	the	economic	return	remains	comprehensive
however	the	sector	standstill	waiting	for	clarity	is	not	the	right	choice
on	the	other	hand	analysis	by	boston	consulting	group	found	that	in	the	subprime	crisis	business	groups	make	immediate	adjustments	to	cope	with	the	situation
operating	results	are	better	than	those	of	the	companies	that	started	to	change	when	the	economic	downturn	was	full
business	modeling	by	dividing	the	crisis	into	three	periods	flatten	fight	and	future	or
will	help	plan	suitable	management	it	compares	the	covid	crisis	and	planning	each	time	to	get	clearer	picture
flatten	during	the	period	when	the	covid	virus	began	to	spread	in	different	areas
and	can	control	there	are	lock	down	and	an	announcement	of	state	of	emergency	in	the	country	for	about	months
to	control	the	spread	during	time	business	owners	must	respond	promptly	to	crises
by	examining	how	the	crisis	has	affected
for	example	having	to	close	the	business	temporarily	reduce	income	and	cause	unemployment	or	economic	recession
then	check	the	cash	flow	liquidity
reduce	unnecessary	expenses	and	may	need	to	cooperate	with	fewer	employees	to	come	to	work	and	ask	for	partial	salary	reduction	to	avoid	layoffs
in	addition	negotiations	with	creditors	should	be	negotiated
owner	or	government	agency	to	delay	payment	debt	settlement	or	taxation
to	help	reduce	the	cost	tension
and	the	most	important	part	of	this	period	is	to	set	up	team	to	develop	response	plan	and	prepare	for	the	fight
fight	the	timing	of	the	covid	outbreak	was	controlled	to	some	extent
but	still	unable	to	produce	vaccines	or	stop	the	outbreak	completely
it	was	time	when	measures	began	to	relax
and	business	began	to	return	to	normal
during	this	period	the	business	owner	must	apply	the	plans	they	have	prepared
the	risks	must	be	assessed	periodically
because	the	situation	has	not	yet	entered	normally
business	planning	from	short	to	long	term	including	backup	plan	to	deal	with	unforeseen	situations	is	essential
business	resurgence	and	monetization	must	be	adjusted	primarily	in	order	to	build	consumer	confidence
the	key	is	to	protect	yourself	employees	customers	and	others	from	infection	by	strictly	following	recommendations	from	public	health	authorities	to	prevent	new	pandemic
the	flight	period	lasts	from	months	and	can	be	if	months	if	the	outbreak	is	not	controlled
future	the	period	when	cure	was	discovered	or	successful	vaccine	was	invented
and	there	is	no	longer	pandemic
which	is	expected	within	the	next	year
during	this	time	both	business	owners	and	consumers	can	now	adjust	and	live	their	normal	life
and	will	cause	wide	economic	expansion
if	the	owner	has	been	well	prepared	since	the	flatten	period	and	can	deal	with	the	uncertainty
along	with	making	comprehensive	business	planning	during	the	fight	it	is	the	right	time	to	adopt	strategies	to	develop	business	for	future	growth
business	planning	to	accommodate	the	new	normalcy	serious	study	of	consumer	behavior	adopting	modern	technology	and	continuous	business	development	are	strategies	that	help	generate	sustainable	income	and	profits	however	no	matter	how	normal	or	better	the	situation	is
business	owners	must	always	be	prepared	to	deal	with	uncertainty
because	no	one	can	predict	what	will	happen	in	the	future
modeling	business	for	dealing	with	crises	with	is	another	step	by	step	approach	to	crisis	management
and	help	them	find	ways	to	cope	with	each	moment	properly
with	the	main	aim	of	allowing	businesses	to	survive	and	continue	under	any	circumstance
for	sme
the	true	story	that	international	businesspeople	face	the	risk	of	the	importer	paying	for	the	product	in	advance	or	paying	the	deposit	but	not	receive	the	products	by	khun	chitphon	phanchaisri	cute	products	plus	company	will	tell	both	the	fun	and	the	risk	of	importing	the	cute	products
from	abroad	to	sell	in	our	country	the	origin	of	cuteness	like	to	eat	like	to	find	delicious	things	to	find	good	things
one	day	go	to	drink	drink
and	feel	very	delicious
why	is	thailand	not	available	for	sale
with	the	feeling	that	when	we	bring	it	to	dad	mother	or	friend	eating	him	happy
saw	his	happiness	when	he	said	that	he	likes	it	it	is	delicious	wants	to	buy	wants	to	eat
khun	mac	chitphol	phanchaisri	ceo	cute	products	plus	co	ltd	importer	of	beverages	and	desserts	from	abroad	to	sell	in	thailand
talks	about	the	starting	point	of	doing	business
the	first	product	was	beverage
after	that	it	started	to	import	snacks	and	snacks	doing	business	for	about	years
currently	there	are	approximately	sku	products	in	the	network
the	company	has	the	concept	of	delivering	happiness	to	general	people
then	he	opened	the	company	to	import	and	we	went	to	find	delicious	goods	from	all	over	the	world
the	company	name	is	cute	product	plus
therefore	the	items	that	imported	must	be	delicious
looks	good	and	cute	like	the	company	name
where	are	imported	from	and	how	are	they	sold
khun	mac	says	that	of	the	products	are	from	japan	are	from	italy	or	europe	the	rest	are	in	asia	such	as	singapore	china	malaysia	and	korea
by	focusing	on	the	middle	to	upper	level	markets	therefore	it	is	available	in	large	modern	trade	in	leading	supermarkets	and	convenient	stores	of	almost	every	brand
sometimes	doing	business	is	not	always	cute	like	the	name	there	are	some	things	in	doing	business
think	everyone	has	wound	already
but	it	also	depends	on	our	management	and	planning	as	well	said	khun	mac
and	then	described	the	methods	of	importing	products	to	sell	including	traveling	to	that	country	in	order	to	see	the	product	if	interested	try	to	find	connection	to	contact
another	way	is	to	go	to	the	trade	fair
which	the	step	is	to	select	to	see	products	if	interested	contact	and	then	buy	and	sell	which	must	be	negotiated	regarding	trading	conditions	mostly	if	finding	the	right	product	from	the	trade	fair
which	both	buyers	and	sellers	have	never	known	before	will	use	the	principle	of	tt	or	advance	which	is	to	pay	first	the	seller	will	deliver	the	item
the	risk	here	is	that	can	trust	him
can	he	trust	me
in	fact	the	risk	can	occur	on	both	sides	both	the	seller	and	the	buyer
the	seller	himself	is	not	sure	about	the	buyer	if	he	ordered	the	item	and	didn	pay
the	seller	must	therefore	be	asked	to	pay	for	the	product	in	advance	to	deliver
as	for	the	buyers	who	have	already	paid	they	also	must	be	afraid	of	whether	they	will	get	the	real	thing	or	not
lose	money	or	not
in	some	cases	the	seller	may	have	lenient	condition	that	deposit	is	to	be	placed	the	risk	is	less
but	even	if	the	money	is	small	but	encountering	unfaithful	sellers	who	do	not	deliver	the	products	is	also	risk	although	the	money	may	not	be	that	much
have	beautiful	booth	at	the	trade	fair	but	some	cannot	be	trusted	khun	mac	talks	about	one	case	that	he	spoke	with	company	in	europe
this	company	also	has	huge	booth	at	the	trade	fair	and	has	license	to	sell	products
which	overall	the	company	has	an	image	with	certain	level	of	reliability	mac	has	been	in	contact	with	this	company	for	while	and	is	preparing	to	order	products	but	has	not	received	orders
haven	transferred	money
friends	in	foreign	countries	that	do	business	too	call	to	ask	if	he	has	transferred	money	or	ordered	products	from	that	company	or	not
because	now	that	company	cannot	reach	which	is	astounding	because	this	company	has	been	in	business	for	ten	years	and	sales	are	in	the	billions	distributing	products	to	at	least	countries
their	port	is	very	good
they	come	to	the	fair	every	year
meet	them	for	years
for	the	first	year	few	events
which	is	very	fortunate	that	we	have	not	transferred	money	before	said	khun
mac	of	his	experience
better	solution	than	trade	fair	khun	mac	goes	on	to	say	that	in	principle	if	you	can	negotiate	with	partner	you	will	get	credit	term	or	small	deposit
but	also	depends	on	the	partner	side	as	to	how	confident	they	are	to	us
most	of	the	partners	will	ask	what	we	do
how	many	ports	how	is	the	company	how	many	years	has	it	been
who	are	the	customers	who	have	been	checking	each	other
but	nowadays	have	met	with	scb	which	has	trade	club	platform	which	can	find	partners	able	to	find	suppliers	overseas
and	scb	already	has	connections	with	banks	in	that	country
if	the	bank	chooses	the	most	it	is	guaranteed	to	be	sure	that	it	is	good	customer	of	the	bank
and	think	that	should	help	build	confidence	between	each	other	and	the	system	of	the	scb	trade	club	must	already	be	registered	to	become	member	the	people	who	will	become	members	here	must	be	scb	customers	first
and	scb	will	check	the	background	in	which	other	banks	in	foreign	trade	clubs	must	have	the	same	principles
so	here	the	bank	will	come	to	help	check	the	profile	now	confident	to	buy	and	sell
khun	mac	talks	about	new	way	to	find	partner	and	suppliers	like	scb	trade	club	that	gives	both	buyers	and	sellers	more	confidence	because	all	trade	partners	that	are	members	of	the	trade	club	have	been	selected	by	leading	banks	in	that	country
has	come	to	be	reliable	and	with	good	financial	credit
walked	out	of	risks	and	concerns	in	doing	import	and	export	business
let	scb	trade	club	be	connection	between	you	and	partners	from	around	the	world	that	have	been	selected	from	leading	banks
can	check	the	history	information	of	partners	by	themselves	online
business	customers	who	are	interested	in	becoming	part	of	the	global	business	network	scb	trade	club	can	request	the	business	relations	manager	or	scb	business	call	center	the	global	trade	platform	designed	to	help	your	business	expand	internationally
when	talking	about	the	thai	drinks	that	are	sold	in	myanmar	in	the	past	it	was	one	of	banned	goods	that	had	been	banned	from	importing	myanmar	since	according	to	the	ministry	of	commerce	of	the	union	of	myanmar	no
november
this	causes	these	products	to	be	smuggled	and	sold	illegally	along	the	myanmar	border
although	it	is	product	that	is	very	popular	with	myanmar	people
but	after	opening	the	country	and	removing	the	barriers	to	foreign	trade	causing	beverage	products	to	be	sold	without	limits
as	result	the	import	volume	has	grown	to	become	the	most	popular	product	of	myanmar	people
over	of	the	beverages	in	myanmar	are	popular	to	be	imported	from	thailand
because	they	love	the	taste	price	and	quality	are	acceptable
it	is	an	opportunity	for	thai	entrepreneurs	to	penetrate	the	myanmar	market
so	today	we	bring	some	drinks	from	myanmar	people	to	study
tea	one	of	myanmar	economic	crops	is	tea	leaves
with	terrain	and	climate	of	myanmar	resulting	in	tea	that	has	mellow	flavor	not	bitter	and	has	unique	aroma
the	popular	tea	among	myanmar	people	is	hot	tea
with	cool	air	and	frosty	in	winter	drinking	hot	tea	helps	to	warm	the	body
in	addition	drinking	water	in	myanmar	must	be	boiled	first	for	good	hygiene
therefore	it	is	popular	to	add	tea	leaves	to	add	flavor	and	aroma
drinking	tea	is	way	of	life	for	myanmar	people
that	does	not	require	tea	ceremony	or	show	luxurious	taste	but	it	is	an	activity	that	occurs	each	day	from	waking	up	until	going	to	bed
myanmar	star	studded	menu	began	to	mix	milk	and	sugar	in	tea
to	add	more	mellow	taste
but	still	like	drinking	hot	tea	which	has	unique	aroma	of	burmese	tea	leaves
when	exploring	the	myanmar	market	we	will	see	big	and	small	tea	houses	along	the	road
the	location	of	the	best	tea	houses	is	under	the	shade	of	large	tree
or	along	the	road	that	people	travel
the	role	of	tea	houses	in	myanmar	is	like	that	of	the	thai	coffee	council
is	place	to	meet	among	people	in	the	community	and	exchange	conversations	with	each	other
as	major	cities	such	as	yangon	mandalay	and	nay	pyi	taw	international	tea	shops	have	opened	such	as	thai	hand	tea	bubble	tea	brands	such	as	koi	and	tiger	sugar	from	taiwan	tea
land	from	singapore	is	also	popular	among	the	middle	class
especially	those	who	are	just	starting	new	job	first	jobber	or	in	the	group	of	students	the	purchasing	power	is	on	the	rise
from	local	people	to	see	potential	growth	channels	in	the	myanmar	market	that	are	not	less	than	any	other	country	in	this	area
coffee	if	you	say	that	tea	is	an	ancient	myanmar	culture	that	dates	to	the	past	and	continues	to	the	present
coffee	is	new	culture	that	has	recently	become	popular	in	myanmar	since	the	country	opening
but	came	in	immediately	and	was	hit	at	once	myanmar	marks	new	wave	of	coffee	beans	production	in	southeast	asia
due	to	the	weather	and	the	terrain	together	with	modern	technology	that	helps	in	cultivation	and	roasted	coffee	beans
this	led	myanmar	to	discover	that	the	coffee	beans	produced	in	the	country	are	of	high	quality
as	result	the	myanmar	government	is	currently	trying	to	push	coffee	beans	to	be	one	of	the	five	major	export	crops	of	the	country
and	aims	to	export	to	all	continents	around	the	world
the	asian	coffee	association	the	asian	coffee	association	in	yunnan	province	china	guarantees	that	myanmar	coffee	tastes	good
and	the	quality	is	second	only	to	indonesia
the	popularity	of	accessing	coffee	shops	in	myanmar	is	co	working	space	to	sit	and	work
or	meet	talk	negotiate	business
as	for	tourists	it	is	popular	to	use	as	leisure	seat	according	to	the	slow	life	trend	in	the	social	world
major	economic	cities	such	as	yangon	are	popular	to	open	western	coffee	shops
for	thai	entrepreneurs	that	have	expanded	their	markets	to	myanmar	and	are	well	known	including	black	canyon	and	true	coffee
in	addition	in	coffee	is	still	favorite	among	myanmar	people
formerly	myanmar	people	prefer	to	drink	tea
is	not	popular	to	drink	coffee	because	of	the	complex	brewing	process	and	as	drink	for	the	sick
but	nowadays	in	coffee	is	produced	domestically	and	many	imported	from	abroad
many	thai	coffee	brands	are	popular
energy	drink	although	myanmar	currently	has	products	that	can	be	manufactured	locally	but	still	unable	to	produce	products	to	meet	the	needs	of	the	people	in	the	country
making	imports	are	very	important
myanmar	imports	of	non	alcoholic	beverages	from	thailand	as	number	worth	about	billion	baht
especially	the	energy	drinks	from	thailand	that	are	very	popular
because	it	is	delicious	drink	and	refresh	is	premium	grade	product	it	looks	luxurious	reinforcing	being	top	end	product
kim	eng	analysis	the	energy	drink	industry	in	myanmar	is	on	the	rise
since	myanmar	has	become	new	wave
the	country	economy	is	on	an	uptrend
this	means	that	myanmar	people	must	work	harder
therefore	it	is	popular	to	drink	energy	drinks	for	freshness	animated	and	increase	energy
the	demand	for	energy	drink	consumption	in	myanmar	thus	increased	in	line	with	economic	growth
this	is	good	time	for	thai	entrepreneurs	to	penetrate	the	local	market	in	myanmar
currently	the	thai	energy	drink	brands	entering	the	myanmar	market	are	osotspa	and	shark	brands	consuming	of	the	market	share	of	the	energy	drinks	imported	from	abroad	and	followed	by	red	bull	and	carabao
strategies	for	thai	investors	to	have	joint	ventures	with	local	companies
and	produce	domestic	products	instead	of	importing	them	directly	from	thailand	to	reduce	production	costs	tax	incentives	and	for	flexibility	in	distributing	products	to	the	local	sports	drinks	are	also	popular	with	myanmar	people
young	people	living	in	big	cities	like	yangon	mandalay	and	nay	pyi	taw	are	becoming	more	concerned	about	health
likes	to	play	sports	in	various	exercise	locations
the	trend	of	exercise	has	increased	since	myanmar	hosted	the	th	sea	games	in	onwards
sports	drinks	are	very	popular
and	many	thai	beverage	brands	are	also	trusted	by	myanmar	people
alcoholic	beverages	according	to	survey	by	the	department	of	international	trade	it	was	found	that	the	most	popular	drinkers	were	males	aged	years	and	over
income	is	still	factor	in	purchasing	decisions
myanmar	people	drink	very	little	alcohol	as	it	is	strict	buddhist	country
popular	drinks	include	locally	brewed	beer	myanmar	beer	dagon	beer	and	abc	beer
however	beer	imported	from	abroad	is	still	popular
and	it	has	become	myanmar	premium	products	including	carlsberg	heineken	kirin	asahi	tiger	and	singha	and	chang	beer	which	consumes	relatively	high	market	share	of	imported	beer	in	myanmar
because	it	is	imported	beer	it	is	cheap	compared	to	local	beer
in	economic	cities	like	yangon	mandalay	and	nay	pyi	taw	beer	is	more	popular	than	liquor
because	it	is	easy	to	drink	and	available	for	sale	in	the	refrigerator	you	can	pick	it	up	from	the	refrigerator	and	drink	it
as	for	the	drinks	that	are	sold	there	are	many	brands	from	local	brands	to	whiskey	imported	from	abroad
in	the	countryside	refrigerators	are	still	not	necessity
ice	is	not	widely	consumed	and	is	expensive
therefore	the	consumption	of	alcohol	for	socializing	relieves	the	tiredness	from	work
or	talk	with	each	other	therefore	myanmar	people	choose	to	drink	their	own	brand	of	myanmar	liquor	and	it	is	non	mixed	drink
fruit	juices	and	soft	drinks	today	myanmar	people	care	more	about	their	health
health	care	drinks	are	very	popular
various	flavors	of	green	tea	will	be	imported	from	thailand	it	is	very	popular	among	the	middle	class
as	for	the	fruit	juice	beverage	it	has	recently	entered	the	myanmar	market
which	is	popular	among	the	wealthy	and	foreigners	living	in	myanmar
after	the	abolition	of	trade	barriers	the	big	soft	drink	business	re	invested	in	myanmar	with	many	strategies	for	fierce	market	competition
but	still	unable	to	discount	the	price	as	low	as	local	brand	soft	drinks
even	imported	soft	drinks	are	of	better	quality
but	with	its	expensive	price	it	becomes	premium	product	that	is	only	available	in	luxury	stores
and	is	often	given	as	gift	and	given	to	each	other	on	special	occasions
at	present	foreign	soft	drink	brands	are	actively	marketing
there	is	joint	venture	with	domestic	soft	drink	producer
and	together	with	government	agencies	organize	many	myanmar	people	development	projects	to	build	brands
and	try	to	make	the	product	more	accessible	to	myanmar	people	as	general	commodity	like	any	other	country
the	beverage	market	in	myanmar	is	still	able	to	support	economic	growth
due	to	the	demand	for	this	type	of	product	there	is	still	lot
because	myanmar	is	becoming	foreign	country	to	invest	in
resulting	in	more	employment	myanmar	people	have	more	purchasing	power	and	like	thai	products	it	is	good	opportunity	for	thai	investors	to	invest	in	myanmar

but	having	good	plan	or	just	being	alert	is	not	enough
cash	flow	must	also	enough	because	it	is	another	key	to	keeping	the	business	going	without	interruption	and	following	the	plan
khun	norawich	managing	director	maverick	group	co	ltd	companies	importing	selling	motorcycle	accessories	spare	parts	many	of	the	world	top	brands	such	as	brembo	bmc	domino	matrist
tell	us	about	his	experience	in	adjusting	his	business	strategy	to	deal	with	covid
and	the	importance	of	cash	flow	in	helping	to	overcome	this	great	crisis
business	background	maverick	group	is	in	the	business	of	importing	and	selling	motorcycle	parts	from	small	motorbike	to	big	size	such	as	big	bike
by	choosing	to	import	the	top	famous	brands	in	the	world	with	high	quality	and	safety	standards
of	products	imported	from	italy
the	rest	is	imported	from	england
principles	of	doing	business	that	the	product	must	be	good	and	safe	because	by	the	motorcycle	itself	which	has	only	two	wheels	is	already	dangerous
therefore	all	products	must	pass	all	european	standards
and	must	be	premium	level	that	has	been	certified	and	tested	successfully
expensive	or	cheap	is	secondary	factor	the	first	thing	must	be	good
because	it	is	safety	said	khun	norawich
maverick	main	business	focuses	on	wholesale	for	dealers
in	which	the	dealer	will	be	motorcycle	shop	selling	spare	parts	for	car	accessories	and	partners	from	big	brands
as	for	the	storefront	there	are	still	some	customers	coming	in
but	the	storefront	is	focused	on	providing	information	and	educating	customers	more
both	the	company	itself	and	the	dealer	have	commerce	services	which	are	also	sold	online
but	storefront	sales	are	better	than	online
in	which	items	sold	online	will	be	trivial	at	low	price	which	makes	customers	dare	to	buy	the	sale	at	the	store	will	be	an	important	item	at	high	price	which	buyers	will	be	more	confident	when	seeing	the	actual	product
changing	business	strategies	after	covid	since	it	is	an	import	business	especially	mainly	imported	from	italy	it	is	well	known	that	italy	is	the	first	country	and	the	first	to	be	affected	by	covid
severely	and	have	the	policy	to	close	the	country	close	the	factory
no	one	knows	when	the	country	will	be	opened
the	policy	is	always	changing
khun	narawit	said	that	almost	have	to	guess
but	it	is	guessed	rule	because	each	supplier	that	deal	with	has	different	lead	times	in	production
when	knowing	that	this	will	happen	it	must	be	adjusted	to	the	plan	first
when	covid	came	we	saw	what	the	effect	will	be
what	are	the	problems
we	know	that	we	are	an	import	company
of	course	italy	must	close	the	country
therefore	what	we	can	do	is	to	stock	as	many	items	as	possible
therefore	need	to	stock	more	than	more
this	is	the	main	factor
khun	norawit	talks	about	adaptation
because	without	products	it	can	be	sold
but	there	is	problem	that	is	the	transportation	cost	that	is	rising	because	of	the	need	to	use	freight	vehicles	from	italy	to	france	first
and	then	fly	from	france	to	thailand	which	makes	it	more	complicated	and	costly
increase	distribution	channels	and	increase	services	for	survival	before	covid	the	company	will	have	many	large	and	medium	sized	dealers	helping	to	distribute	products
but	when	covid	happened	dealers	are	not	brave	enough	to	stock	up	because	they	are	afraid	they	won	have	customers	or	don	want	to	spend	money
in	order	to	keep	the	business	going	the	distribution	channels	must	be	distributed	in	small	shops	as	well
by	delivering	the	item	to	them	without	having	to	stock	up	on	their	own	and	then	give	the	price	difference
plus	onsite	onsite	service	for	additional	support
which	is	to	go	to	provide	service	at	the	customer	home	or	place	that	the	customer	wants	right	away	which	is	service	that	just	happened	during	the	covid	period	which	must	be	done	to	survive
if	we	can	do	it	we	can	live
our	employees	have	more	than	people	but	not	just	more	than	people	but	more	than	families
don	want	to	lay	off	employees
so	we	came	up	with	what	if	customer	does	not	enter	our	store	what	to	do
okay	then	we	ll	go	to	the	customer
khun	norawit	talks	about	the	origin	of	the	new	service	that	is	becoming	new	normal
but	serving	customer	must	have	way	to	do	it	safely
not	risking	covid	such	as	not	being	near	customers
to	bring	the	motorcycle	to	park	at	the	prepared	location	and	the	mechanic	will	disinfect	everything	and	go	into	work
soft	loan	is	an	important	factor	in	driving	the	strategy	into	reality	in	order	to	increase	inventory	by	cash	flow	is	key	to	making	this	strategy	reality
but	this	problem	is	possible	with	soft	loans	from	scb	and	the	bank	of	thailand
khun	norawit	said	that	he	learned	about	soft	loans	from	rm	which	contacted	to	update	news	and	new	products	consistently
including	the	soft	loan	itself	which	scb	is	the	assistant	to	handle	all	the	documents
which	received	loan	of	of	the	outstanding	balance	on	december	with	interest	at	for	two	years	and	not	having	to	pay	interest	in	the	first	months	which	doesn	take	about	week	make	money	to	catch	up	with	demand
loans	help	to	stock	up	more	items
because	if	we	are	not	in	stock	must	hope	that	the	factory	will	open
if	we	don	have	our	products	we	can	for	sure	so	if	we	have	items	that	sell	even	if	they	sell	out	or	they	can	still	sell
khun	norawit	said
he	also	shared	his	appreciation	for	scb	that	he	was	very	busy	in	his	business
there	is	no	time	to	update	new	information	or	financial	services
fortunately	scb	rm	is	always	up	to	date	and	providing	advice
including	providing	fast	services
which	includes	managing	soft	loans	that	can	make	his	business	strategy	through	the	crisis	happened
what	has	been	learned	from	khun	norawit	is	must	constantly	monitor	situations	related	to	your	business	and	plan	to	cope	before	the	event	becomes	so	intense	that	you	cannot	cope
must	adjust	strategies	and	services	to	be	in	line	with	the	situation
and	the	most	impressive	thing	is	the	concern	and	take	care	not	to	abandon	employees
which	the	result	of	having	the	heart	of	strong	leader	ready	to	cause	him	to	find	new	service	that	is	new	normal
another	thing	that	is	having	good	business	partner
who	was	there	to	provide	information	knowledge	and	guiding	the	path	to	survival
let	scb	sme	be	friend	to	walk	beside	for	advice
support	your	business	to	grow	and	overcome	the	crisis
with	confidence	in	the	potential	of	thai	smes
for	smes	interested	in	applying	for	soft	loan	can	contact	the	relationship	manager	that	takes	care	of	you	or	contact	the	call	center	at	for	sme	new	digital	banking	platform	for	enhancing	the	good	financial	experience	for	business	customers
skootar	the	transformation	of	thai	messenger	for	thai	people	skootar	thai	startup	online	messenger	calling	service	provider	through	an	application	that	was	made	for	real	thai	people
by	finding	solutions	based	on	customer	needs	and	the	messenger	network	to	meet	each	other	while	raising	the	bar	for	professional	quick	error	free	service
as	result	skootar	was	able	to	successfully	become	one	of	the	lineups	of	the	thai	messenger	app	provider	field	among	international	players

kamonpruet	chumpon	khun	ko	ceo	of	skootar	will	share	the	thinking	method	for	business	pioneer
as	well	as	expanding	new	business	opportunities
especially	when	consumer	behavior	changes	rapidly
get	to	the	level	of	thai	messenger	to	be	pro	skootaronline	messenger	service	is	thai	startup	founded	by	scootar	beyond	co	ltd	developed	in	mid	by	developing	websites	and	mobile	applications	linked	to	the	messenger	network	across	bangkok	and	suburbs
serve	in	receive	send	documents	keep	checks	billing	or	deliver	other	items	within	day
the	service	can	be	called	anytime	and	anywhere	through	the	website	and	application	with	standard	price	calculated	based	on	actual	distance
along	with	having	system	to	track	progress	and	evaluate	employees	performance	for	service	users	to	get	the	best	driver	only
including	accident	and	damage	insurance
convenient	payments	through	multiple	channels	there	is	also	billing	system	for	company	customers	and	receipt	is	issued	every	time	you	use	the	service
interested	in	the	service	see	hereskootar	starting	from	pain	point	to	the	thai	messenger	business
the	origin	of	thai	startups	like	skootar	khun	ko	said	starting	from	khun	ko	and	two	partners	saw	the	problem	that	many	smes	often	had	paperwork	both	receive	send	documents	drop	receive	bills	receive	checks	send	reports
which	if	you	look	at	the	surface	may	think	that	it	is	small	thing	but	for	smes	it	is	big	deal
because	if	the	bill	is	not	scheduled	it	will	result	in	late	receipt	of	money	or	may	have	to	wait	for	the	next	month	billing	cycle
maintaining	cash	flow	for	smes	is	important
most	smes	therefore	must	find	solution	by	having	regular	messenger
to	run	the	work	so	that	it	can	reduce	errors	and	understand	the	system	without	having	to	constantly	teach	new	work
including	having	to	be	trusted	can	track	the	driver	to	where	he	is	working	and	success	or	not
but	it	can	be	difficult	to	find	good	messenger	and	the	skilled	workers	are	so	busy	that	when	there	is	urgent	document	delivery	the	queue	may	not	be	as	desired	causing	frequent	headaches
while	the	messenger	career	had	problems	with	the	consistency	of	the	job
some	days	lot	of	customers	some	days	little	or	no	customers	causing	unstable	income	or	perhaps	having	to	deliver	documents	far	away	but	on	the	way	back	must	drive	with	no	job	making	it	not	worth	the	job
from	the	problems	of	both	the	customer	and	the	messenger	it	is	the	origin	of	skootar
starting	business	not	only	have	to	find	solution	to	fix	pain	point	but	also	need	to	focus	on	the	right	group
for	skootar	try	to	find	way	to	penetrate	the	messenger	market	in	thailand
where	the	main	players	are	traditional	messenger	companies	and	the	second	is	group	of	foreign	platforms
but	for	skootar	not	at	all	afraid	of	the	capital	giant
because	he	can	see	that	the	main	customers	focus	on	the	sme	business	which	is	the	document	delivery	job	that	requires	specific	expertise	and	skootar	can	meet	the	needs	of	sme	customers
when	the	business	started	to	emerge	skootar	began	to	expand	its	customer	base	until	now	there	are	main	customer	groups	the	first	group	is	the	document	oriented	smes	the	second	group	is	commerce	customers	the	third	group	is	food	delivery	and	the	fourth	group	is	the	general	customers
currently	the	proportion	of	using	the	courier	service	is	about	parcel	delivery	and	food	delivery
because	of	the	foundation	and	step	by	step	to	be	confident	skootar	has	gradually	grown	steadily
the	skootar	route	is	not	sprinkled	with	rose	petals	of	course	most	start	up	roads	are	faced	with	tough	stories
through	the	thorn	leaving	scar	to	remember
so	is	skootar
khun	ko	said	that	at	the	launch	of	the	new	months	no	customers	at	all
at	that	time	it	was	just	website	there	was	no	application	yet
without	customers	it	fights	with	advertising	and	marketing	trials
it	appears	that	it	works
start	to	have	trial	customer	at	that	time	he	hurriedly	asked	the	customer	feedback	to	see	how	the	service	was
then	be	modified	to	respond	to	the	needs	of	the	customers	quickly
the	start	might	not	be	perfect	but	it	been	fine
gradually	grow	little	by	now	skootar	has	been	serving	for	more	than	years
when	asked	if	there	are	any	tips	for	growing	up	khun	ko	recommends	that	always	must	think	that	there	is	not	much	capital
therefore	he	must	focus	on	the	customer	problem	whether	it	is	solved	or	not
listen	to	the	voice	of	the	customer	lot	and	change	quickly
customer	feedback	or	messenger	feedback	is	like	flashlight	that	shines	in	the	right	direction	or	not
should	he	go	further	or	modify
where	to	develop
for	example	skootar	has	data	collection	showing	information	that	can	be	used	to	further	business
such	as	from	the	original	only	had	motorcycles	then	added	four	wheel	vehicle	service	by	working	with	taxi	cooperative	to	recruit	car	drivers
because	they	saw	some	signs	that	there	was	need	or	should	expand	the	service	to	major	cities	in	other	provinces
the	messenger	team	takes	care	of	them	to	have	good	quality	of	life	by	renting	out	new	motorcycles
making	life	insurance	etc
skootar	highlights	skootar	growth	may	not	be	as	noticeable	as	other	businesses
when	asked	what	the	point	is	of	being	able	to	stand	in	the	middle	of	messenger	field	where	foreign	giants	have	taken	over	the	field
khun	ko	replied	that	because	of	the	quality	and	service	standards
our	messenger	is	special	because	before	going	out	to	work	training	is	required	and	must	take	the	exam	and	score	at	in	order	to	perform	the	task
the	application	is	designed	to	be	easy	to	use	for	both	the	user	and	the	messenger
there	is	feature	to	meet	the	needs	of	smes	who	want	to	track	their	status	and	submit	multiple	jobs	or	document	work	that	requires	special	expertise
this	causes	almost	no	or	no	errors	in	document	delivery
there	is	also	favorite	driver	feature	to	encourage	messenger	to	focus	on	their
because	if	there	are	regular	customers	and	will	have	consistent	income
as	for	the	customers	they	are	at	ease	can	be	used	easily	without	having	to	worry	because	they	understand	each	other	or	not	have	to	communicate	again
there	is	service	rating	system	to	control	the	quality	of	the	service	with	highly	rated	driver	the	more	likely	the	system	will	show	them	to	customers	first
causing	drivers	to	constantly	improve	their	services	the	current	average	score	of	skootar	messenger	team	is	out	of	it	ensures	that	our	customers	will	receive	the	best	service	from	professionals
in	addition	it	offers	wide	range	of	services	including	paperwork	parcel	delivery	food	delivery	and	professional	messenger	team	of	over	professionals	available	in	bangkok	and	its	vicinity
top	form	messenger	generate	an	income	of	baht	per	month	career	messenger	many	people	may	think	that	their	income	is	not	much	more	than	baht	per	month
but	khun	ko	said	that	the	revenue	of	the	top	form	messenger	can	generate	income	up	to	baht	per	month
when	asked	if	there	are	any	techniques	to	make	such	high	income	khun	ko	said	that	from	data	it	was	found	that	the	highly	paid	messenger	comes	from	many	factors	including	ride	every	day	without	break	working	hard	for	more	than	hours	day	good	service	quality	customer	satisfaction	until	having	lot	of	regulars	customers
has	wide	range	of	delivery	skills	including	paperwork	parcel	delivery	food	delivery	because	of	work	but	with	different	skills
in	the	end	not	choosing	job	not	being	poor	and	working	hard	can	make	substantial	income
such	good	income	like	this	if	interested	in	applying	as	messenger	what	are	the	qualifications
khun	ko	said	that	skootar	is	open	to	everyone	with	or	without	experience
just	have	motorcycle	for	running
have	an	android	mobile	phone	no	history	of	serious	cases	good	manners	service	minded	can	be	team	of	skootar	see	more	details	growth	trend	of	food	delivery	business	during	covid	the	food	delivery	business	flourished
consumers	turned	to	many	food	orderings	services
skootar	as	thai	messenger	service	is	also	encouraged	by	this	event
khun	koh	said	that	it	can	be	said	that	there	is	both	crisis	and	an	opportunity
such	as	the	main	customer	groups	smes	who	use	the	document	delivery	service	of	course	that	was	greatly	reduced	as	some	companies	shut	down
causing	some	companies	to	not	have	job	such	as	tour	operator	that	previously	had	to	go	out	to	get	the	documents	of	the	tour	client	when	it	was	locked	down	the	business	was	disrupted
businesses	can	balance	their	customer	portfolios
even	the	messenger	who	used	to	send	the	documents	before	but	in	this	situation	must	adjust	and	turn	to	food	delivery	instead
looking	at	the	growth	trends	of	food	delivery	khun	ko	sees	that	there	is	an	opportunity	to	continue	to	grow
because	the	behavior	of	consumers	has	become	accustomed	to	ordering	food	to	eat	at	home
businesses	are	beginning	to	have	gap	creating	new	players	who	have	seen	problems	from	this	point	such	as	scb	that	has	launched	robinhood	free	food	delivery	app
no	application	fee	no	gp	fee	gross	profit
the	restaurant	receives	every	baht	every	penny	making	it	possible	to	sell	food	that	is	of	the	right	quality	and	quantity
as	for	the	customers	pay	for	food	and	delivery	fee	according	to	the	actual	cost
this	is	beneficial	to	society	giving	fairness	to	all	parties	and	skootar	has	been	given	the	opportunity	to	become	partner	with	scb	in	food	delivery	with	robinhood
it	can	be	considered	handshake	that	has	been	paired	with	thai	startups	skootar	and	robinhood	thai	app	for	thai	people
find	out	more	about	robinhood	here	how	to	create	successful	startup
the	experience	that	started	after	being	thai	startup	has	been	in	business	for	more	than	years
mr	ko	shared	that	startups	are	divided	into	parts	start	start	by	listening	to	the	whisper	from	customers	about	what	the	customer	is	having
then	they	come	up	with	products	or	services	that	solve	the	problem
if	you	create	something	that	has	never	been	done	before	there	are	many	opportunities	for	your	business	to	grow
and	use	technology	to	help	solve	problems	lighten	the	burden	on	customers
then	choose	team	that	is	suitable	for	your	business	type
and	need	to	focus	on	customer	groups	because	the	funds	are	not	thick	so	must	catch	customers	in	the	right	spot	find	customers
stop	reduce	the	fear	of	the	capital	thickening
but	look	for	opportunities	from	business	gaps
continue	don	get	caught	in	the	same	success	trap
when	he	started	to	live	he	had	to	improve	products	and	develop	services	all	the	time
and	finally	having	enough	cash	flow	management	to	support	the	business	will	allow	startups	to	continue
with	the	intention	of	raising	the	standard	of	messenger	service	through	an	application	that	is	truly	made	for	thai	people	skootar	thai	start	up	has	proven	that	there	is	no	need	for	large	capital
just	have	creative	idea	fix	the	problem	to	the	right	point	analyze	the	target	audience	to	find	the	right	target
opportunities	for	thai	startups	to	become	unicorns	are	certainly	within	reach

many	businesses	have	adjusted	themselves	to	changes	during	the	covid	pandemic
some	businesses	created	new	opportunity	against	the	crisis	while	others	have	controlled	their	expenses	for	survival
no	matter	what	kind	of	change	tax	is	an	important	issue	that	entrepreneurs	must	know
tax	planning	things	need	to	do	before	starting	business
personal	or	juristic	person	business	entrepreneurs	should	make	their	decision	when	starting	business	whether	it	will	be	personal	or	juristic	person	as	tax	rate	varies	by	the	type	of	business
for	business	with	net	income	over	baht	registration	as	juristic	person	is	recommended	because	entrepreneurs	pay	tax	at	which	is	less	than	the	individual	income	rate
ref	individual	income	tax	rate	and	juristic	person	income	tax	rate	advance	tax	plan	good	accounting	system	requires	an	advance	tax	plan	starting	by	recording	income	expense	and	keeping	track	of	all	financial	transactions	aligning	with	accounting	standards	and	tax	law
proper	practice	will	help	entrepreneurs	forecast	how	much	tax	to	pay	and	then	plan	ahead	for	actual	expenses	to	get	the	tax	breaks
entrepreneurs	who	have	no	background	in	accounting	please	download	rdsmes	free	at	define	objectives	if	entrepreneurs	want	to	register	the	company	as	juristic	person	they	should	define	objectives	by	considering	potential	business	in	the	future
in	case	theres	any	change	or	extension	in	the	business	model	the	company	objectives	must	be	amended	according	to	the	criteria	of	the	department	of	business	development	so	that	the	business	can	sustain	itself	legitimately
vat	registration	if	an	annual	net	income	is	over	million	baht	please	consider	registering	your	business	for	vat	within	days	from	the	date	achieving	million	baht
entrepreneurs	can	check	the	list	of	businesses	with	vat	exemption	and	start	paying	vat	for	extra	income
if	entrepreneurs	violate	this	rule	their	taxes	will	be	additionally	charged	back	from	the	revenue	departmentv
apart	from	tax	planning	entrepreneurs	should	know	about	expenses	that	can	be	managed	for	tax	savings	as	follows	deduction	of	wear	cost	and	depreciation	on	the	date	owning	the	assets	at	of	cost	value	for	assets	like	computer	and	machine	and	for	assets	like	factory	manufacturing	plant
two	times	of	expenses	for	wages	of	the	elderly	over	years	old	and	no	more	than	baht	can	be	deducted

besides	entrepreneurs	who	registered	their	businesses	for	vat	will	get	vat	exemption	from	march	to	march	good	tax	planning	is	another	factor	to	help	the	business	run	smoothly	especially	expenses	that	have	the	potential	to	get	tax	deductions
its	important	for	entrepreneurs	to	follow	up	on	news	from	the	revenue	department	to	ensure	that	they	dont	miss	out	on	all	the	advantages

and	from	the	grandmother	bought	thai	house	from	the	villagers	to	build	new	houses	which	is	called	thai	village
in	addition	thai	tourism	became	famous	over	years	ago
the	damnoen	saduak	floating	market	is	famous	tourist	destination	among	foreign	tourists
therefore	is	turning	point	for	sampran	park	entering	the	tourism	business	seriously
in	sampran	park	was	stopover	for	tourists	visiting	the	floating	market
while	watching	show	at	the	thai	village	during	the	booming	business	there	are	tourists	per	day
however	in	the	latter	the	era	has	changed
tourists	have	more	choices
and	this	type	of	tourist	activity	began	to	spread	everywhere	tourists	become	less
as	the	rd	generation	of	samphran	successor	arus	must	find	strategy	to	recover	the	family	business	situation
organic	agriculture	is	the	turning	point
from	khun	arus	is	interested	in	healthy	food	therefore	have	the	idea	to	grow	organic	vegetables	on	the	other	side	of	the	river	opposite	sampran	garden
the	hotel	gardener	is	not	an	expert	in	agriculture
arus	therefore	went	to	ask	for	knowledge	with	farmers	in	the	area
which	is	considered	new	world	opening	for	khun	arus	to	ask	the	question	why	buy	agricultural	products	through	middlemen
which	people	who	come	to	the	suk	jai	market	also	come	to	the	sampran	garden	too
regarded	as	the	selling	point	of	the	hotel	and	farmers	also	have	income	from	the	sale	of	goods	at	the	sukjai	market	in	addition	to	delivering	products	to	the	hotel
because	farmers	in	the	area	were	able	to	produce	vegetables	and	fruits	to	send	to	sampran	gardens
became	patom	organic	farm	that	has	been	certified	with	international	standards
in	which	arus	and	the	sampran	garden	teamwork	with	farmers	in	the	area	of	organic	vegetable	growing
and	the	suan	sampran	hotel	was	bought	as	healthy	raw	material	for	guests	staying
at	the	same	time	khun	arus	initiated	sampran	park	to	have	hand	on	experience	in	organic	farming	for	tourists
by	changing	the	thai	village	formerly	used	to	display	the	show	as	patom	organic	village	organize	organic	processing	products	that	focus	on	allowing	visitors	to	participate	in	the	activities
including	the	opening	of	suk	jai	market	organic	farming	market	adjacent	to	the	thai	village
that	allows	farmers	to	open	stall	selling	organic	crops	organic	farming	is	turning	point	for	improving	the	lives	of	farmers
from	the	original	the	use	of	chemicals	that	affect	the	health	of	farmers	and	causing	debt	because	chemicals	are	more	expensive	every	year
lead	to	worse	environment	disease	and	insect	resistance	and	circling	back	to	the	need	to	use	stronger	chemicals
however	distribution	through	middlemen	causing	crops	to	reach	consumers	at	high	price
at	the	same	time	consumers	lack	knowledge	about	the	effects	of	pesticide	residues	and	there	are	few	organic	purchasing	sources
when	switching	to	organic	farming	agricultural	health	has	improved	and	agricultural	costs	can	also	be	reduced	and	free	from	debt
also	the	environment	is	improved
for	those	who	are	alert	about	organic	agriculture	and	have	access	to	organic	produce	at	fair	and	reliable	price	through	fair	mediator	is	balanced	diet	system
pushing	society	better	in	the	big	picture
reorganization	join	hands	with	partners	to	create	business	that	drives	society	for	sampran	today	arus	doesn	see	herself	as	hotel	business
but	want	to	be	an	area	to	inspire	learning	for	change	and	deliver	value	to	customers
which	is	divided	into	axes	which	are	suan	sampran	which	has	hotels	restaurants	meeting	rooms	gardens
with	sampran	model	which	is	model	to	support	society	consisting	of	the	suk	jai	society	foundation	suk	jai	organic	social	business	and	sampran	model	academy	is	another	axis
and	finish	with	tatom	organic	living	with	organic	lifestyle	products	such	as	patom	organic	caf	bangkok	patom	organic	bar	patom	organic	farm	etc
khun	arus	emphasized	that	the	involvement	of	organizations	in	this	type	of	society	does	not	require	additional	investment
but	important	to	change	the	way	you	think	out	of	the	original	framework
for	example	chefs	who	used	to	cook	according	to	menus	that	bought	ingredients	from	middlemen
but	organic	vegetables	from	local	farmers	daily	are	limited
chefs	must	change	to	try	new	menus	that	can	be	made	from	organic	ingredients	that	day
which	employees	will	accept	this	change
we	must	communicate	to	them	about	the	common	ideology	of	driving	society	is	meaningful	work
and	the	heart	of	the	samphran	model	is	alliances	partnership	consisting	of	farmers	group	of	organic	agricultural	entrepreneurs	sme	entrepreneurs	who	do	business	in	support	of	society	inclusive	business	active	consumers	who	are	responsible	active	consumer	to	be	leader	to	change	to	create	better	society
with	each	side	exchanging	learning	and	doing	fair	trade	with	each	other	it	builds	trust	trust	through	the	certification	system
all	of	this	leads	to	increased	capacity	and	knowledge	management	by	the	sampran	model	academy
organic	tourism	encourages	customers	to	participate	in	creating	sustainable	society	according	to	the	tourism	authority	of	thailand	tat	data	conscious	traveler	is	the	most	popular	tourist	group
which	are	the	tourists	who	want	to	create	change	most	are	tourists	from	scandinavian	countries
business	that	supports	society	that	connects	from	upstream	to	downstream
therefore	is	learning	journey	selling	experience	creating	value	for	this	group	of	customers	nowadays	there	is	group	of	hotel	operators	and	restaurants	that	agree	with	the	concept	of	organic	tourism	that	drives	society	with	organic	products	presenting	customers	who	come	to	travel
for	example	the	hotel	cooks	dishes	from	organic	vegetables	for	guests
for	example	hotels	cook	food	menus	from	hotels	and	restaurants
is	the	link	between	producers	and	consumers	organic	vegetables	for	the	guests
which	in	addition	to	organic	products	is	good	for	health
clients	know	that	they	have	helped	farmers	because	the	money	he	pays	goes	directly	to	farmers
enhancing	business	services	to	more	advanced	than	ever	new	digital	banking	platform	for	enhancing	the	good	financial	experience	for	business	customers
keys	to	build	successful	brand	and	make	it	remain	in	the	heart	of	online	customers	is	must	in	the	next	normal	business	era
sme	entrepreneurs	have	to	know	and	decode	the	secret	behind	the	success	of	great	ladies	from	sme	hero
they	all	come	from	different	types	of	business	are	equipped	with	different	techniques	and	perceive	different	perspectives
they	are	ms	yim	wanida	praparat	founder	and	creative	director	at	hamburger	studio	ms	uhn	pannakorn	chantarugka	ceo	of	npp	box	and	ms	ying	nednaphit	rungthanakiat	managing	director	of	lamoon	baby
interesting	tips	for	business	to	grow	uhn	from	npp	box	shared	that	she	did	not	intend	her	business	to	grow	by	leaps	and	bounds
she	operated	her	business	with	npp	power	business	management	strategy	that	focuses	on	powers	manpower	cooperation	power	and	creative	power	and	these	will	allow	the	organization	to	grow	sustainably
manpower	consists	of	groups	of	people	who	are	customers	business	partners	and	staff
in	terms	of	staff	the	duty	of	the	manager	is	to	ensure	their	wellbeing
they	have	to	focus	on	recruiting	staff	who	have	similar	attitude	to	the	organization	to	establish	peaceful	and	happy	working	environment	as	well	as	emphasize	teamwork
cooperation	power
originally	uhns	intention	was	not	to	just	produce	boxes
she	wanted	her	product	to	become	more	than	just	box
thus	the	company	needs	to	rely	on	others	strengths	as	well	because	some	of	the	things	cannot	be	solely	done	by	the	company
they	then	looked	for	partners	who	share	similar	attitudes	and	goals
for	example	the	company	wanted	to	pass	forward	the	inspiration	so	they	produced	show	the	idol	the	show	that	talks	about	interesting	stories	of	their	customers	such	as	ms	noon	veterinarian	and	ceo	of	swimsuit	brand
after	the	show	was	broadcasted	many	audiences	were	inspired	to	make	their	dream	comes	true
this	fulfilled	uhn	and	noons	hearts	as	they	could	pass	forward	this	inspiring	power	to	others
also	uhn	collaborated	with	dr	pairoj	the	creator	of	thai	tone	to	meet	customers	demands	of	nammak	red	and	khram	blue	box	in	which	these	colors	do	not	appear	in	regular	pantone
and	came	the	thai	tone	collection	boxes	in	thai	color	tones
creative	power
there	must	be	no	such	thing	as	cannot	be	done	there	must	only	be	how	to	do
when	one	thinks	of	the	way	to	get	things	done	they	will	imagine	it	into	the	tangible	plan	and	possible	operation	plan	will	follow
this	is	how	postal	box	collection	came	about
his	collection	personified	boxes	into	human	characters	and	presented	them	through	models	or	expanded	the	idea	by	designing	boxes	into	company	uniforms	and	there	were	customers	who	wanted	to	purchase	the	company	uniforms
this	shows	that	creative	power	can	bring	about	business	expansion
ying	from	lamoon	baby	has	motto	whatever	that	is	heart	made	it	will	definitely	come	out	perfect
there	are	heart	made	actions	she	mentioned
they	are	made	by	heart	is	the	heart	that	gets	to	customers	hearts
knowing	what	customers	are	seeking	what	problems	they	have	what	they	are	thinking	and	feeling	and	how	these	affect	their	behaviors	will	help	the	company	to	create	products	and	services	that	perfectly	meet	the	demands	of	customers
believe	that	everything	is	possible	and	never	say	no	only	say	yes
with	this	belief	in	mind	every	idea	will	not	be	judged
all	ideas	will	have	value	and	meaning	and	these	ideas	will	be	developed	further	to	become	big	ideas
problems	and	obstacles	will	then	be	overcome	to	reach	the	finishing	line	and	this	allows	business	to	continue	to	grow
ever	readiness	to	adapt	and	change
since	online	business	changes	rapidly	one	should	not	hold	on	to	past	achievements	and	ideas	but	must	always	be	ready	to	adapt	and	learn	to	catch	up	with	the	new	opportunities	that	they	will	encounter
yim	founder	and	creative	director	at	hamburger	studio	mentioned	that	the	origin	of	every	brand	is	its	founder
it	does	not	matter	if	founders	love	or	have	passion	for	what	they	are	doing	they	need	to	have	faith	and	spread	this	belief	to	their	brand
the	action	of	the	brand	has	to	be	vivid	because	it	will	be	sent	as	message	through	all	channels	and	reach	customers
for	example	hamburger	feels	that	it	is	friend	of	many	women	who	will	go	out	and	look	confident
after	they	are	confident	with	their	appearance	they	will	look	good	and	confident	in	everything	they	do
when	ying	started	making	this	brand	she	used	online	platforms
she	announced	her	brand	existence	by	constructing	the	character	brand	page	administrator	and	content	creator
all	that	mentioned	will	need	to	have	the	same	characteristic	because	they	are	points	of	contact	with	customers
in	online	platforms	one	has	only	about	seconds	to	make	customers	notice	and	remember	the	brand
all	messages	conveyed	have	to	be	clear
after	constructing	an	online	existence	the	brand	has	to	then	stand	at	where	customers	stand	for	customers	to	remember	the	brand	and	for	the	brand	to	remember	customers
in	order	to	remember	customers	business	will	have	to	make	use	of	data	frequent	engage	with	customers	and	keep	track	of	customer	journey	to	develop	the	business	as	well	as	hiring	influencers	who	are	important	figures	in	fashion	business
overcome	obstacles	in	business	yim	from	hamburger	studio	felt	that	the	challenge	in	the	fashion	business	is	that	it	mainly	relies	on	customer	demand	while	customer	demand	changes	very	fast
also	in	retail	business	business	owners	will	have	to	produce	their	own	products	and	this	brings	about	problems	all	the	time
for	example	originally	production	took	place	in	china	for	the	first	years	of	running	business	and	had	just	change	the	production	location	to	thailand	because	the	business	wanted	to	support	domestic	labor	and	the	flow	of	domestic	income
however	after	beginning	operation	in	thailand	the	business	found	out	that	big	factories	could	not	respond	to	the	production	need	as	the	cost	and	order	were	too	high
when	the	business	moved	their	production	to	the	medium	factory	they	faced	with	delay	in	delivery	such	as	the	chinese	lunar	new	year	collection	that	the	factory	could	not	deliver	in	time	and	the	company	missed	the	opportunity	to	have	their	place	in	the	market	resulting	in	putting	the	collection	on	sale	eventually
despite	encountering	problems	yim	still	wanted	the	fashion	business	to	take	thailand	as	their	production	fort
nevertheless	do	not	place	too	much	trust	or	be	too	contented
businesses	have	to	realize	their	production	capability
the	brand	has	to	take	longer	time	to	prepare	for	production	and	needs	to	have	number	of	factories	in	hand	to	ensure	the	production
uhn	ceo	of	npp	box	shared	that	the	end	of	her	familys	packaging	business	was	the	beginning	of	npp	box
one	day	she	received	bad	news	that	her	familys	factory	would	be	taken	over	in	month	time
she	was	surprised	and	confused	because	she	had	never	heard	about	it	from	her	family	members	and	she	did	not	help	out	in	her	family	business
on	that	day	she	went	to	the	factory	sat	in	front	of	the	machinery	and	thought	hard	about	what	to	do	next
the	pictures	of	employees	who	worked	with	this	business	for	over	years	flashed	right	before	her	eyes	and	that	was	when	she	decided	that	she	would	leave	no	one	behind
uhn	thus	told	her	mother	that	she	would	take	over	the	business	despite	having	zero	knowledge	on	packaging	business
her	mother	approved	the	request	with	condition	that	uhn	had	to	find	million	baht	and	pay	to	the	bank
luckily	uhn	could	get	the	money	with	the	help	of	her	friends	mother
early	therefore	marked	the	beginning	of	uhn	in	packaging	business	and	the	old	factory	had	officially	transformed	into	npp	box	business
it	was	challenge	for	person	who	knew	nothing	about	this	field	of	business	like	herself	to	run	it	and	ensure	its	survival
uhn	began	her	post	as	the	ceo	by	looking	for	the	source	of	the	problem	and	found	that	the	former	business	fought	in	the	pricing	war
their	boxes	had	no	value	and	could	not	match	with	big	factories
the	intended	that	npp	would	not	walk	the	same	path	as	the	previous	company
after	that	she	had	to	go	on	quest	looking	for	identity	by	having	npp	box	as	creator	of	love	at	first	sight
product	in	the	box	had	to	establish	love	at	first	sight	to	people	who	received	it
next	this	goal	would	have	to	be	conveyed	to	staff	in	the	organization	to	ensure	that	everyone	and	everything	would	head	in	the	same	direction
and	when	one	wished	their	product	to	become	love	at	first	sight	their	workplace	would	have	to	be	love	at	first	sight	to	begin	with
so	when	there	was	no	order	uhn	renovated	the	factory	painted	it	anew	and	renovated	toilets
after	having	place	to	fall	in	love	there	must	be	product	to	show	love
the	machinery	in	the	former	factory	was	more	than	years	old	with	people	hardly	using	it	anymore
normally	box	production	will	have	an	error	of	millimeters	but	hers	had	an	error	of	centimeters
she	solved	this	problem	by	measure	each	and	every	box	by	hand	and	the	most	she	had	done	was	up	to	thousand	boxes	to	make	her	product	love	at	first	sight	as	she	wished
when	people	within	the	organization	were	ready	to	fight	the	company	started	to	communicate	with	customers	through	various	online	platforms	that	were	available
they	did	not	choose	all	the	platforms	but	only	those	that	they	were	good	at
this	was	because	if	they	got	themselves	on	the	platforms	that	were	not	their	forte	and	did	not	do	well	it	would	affect	the	reputation	of	the	brand
in	conclusion	one	will	have	to	search	for	the	source	of	the	problem	construct	identity	convey	to	the	organization	and	communicate	with	customers
ying	from	lamoon	baby	said	that	she	had	been	running	this	business	for	more	than	years	but	nobody	would	believe	that	she	and	her	partners	did	not	receive	any	income	in	the	first	years
they	did	not	get	any	salary	or	bonus
the	factor	that	kept	the	company	going	was	its	objective
they	knew	what	they	were	doing	this	for
they	knew	that	they	want	to	make	the	best	organic	product	for	young	children	to	use	by	inventing	formula	with	the	best	ingredients
some	ingredients	cannot	be	found	in	thailand	and	have	to	be	imported
this	resulted	in	high	cost	of	production	when	compared	to	other	mother	and	baby	care	products	in	the	market
at	the	same	time	they	did	not	set	high	price	for	their	product	because	they	wanted	to	make	it	affordable	and	wanted	all	young	children	to	use	the	quality	gentle	products
therefore	their	profit	was	really	low
cash	flow	was	required	all	the	time
other	people	asked	ying	if	she	was	crazy	to	do	business	that	does	not	gain	her	money
those	questions	did	not	make	her	wavered	as	she	knew	what	she	was	doing	all	these	for
as	she	put	her	heart	into	doing	her	business	ying	gained	the	hearts	of	her	customers	in	form	of	feedbacks	that	group	of	mothers	sent	to	her	via	various	online	platforms
for	example	thank	you	so	much	for	making	the	product
my	child	isnt	allergic	to	it	at	all	thank	you	so	much	for	making	my	child	sleep	tight	throughout	the	night	for	the	first	time	ever	since	they	were	born	thank	you	so	much	for	making	my	child	waking	up	with	smile	for	the	first	time	and	many	more	voices	that	brought	her	to	tears	of	joy
that	is	her	true	happiness
to	do	whatever	will	fulfill	her	goal	and	people	see	values	in	it	is	an	encouragement	to	herself	that	even	though	it	is	tiring	and	disheartening	she	has	never	given	up	and	she	fought	her	way	to	have	everything	today
how	to	understand	customers	insight	yim	from	hamburger	studio	said	that	as	her	brand	has	both	online	and	offline	platforms	she	frequently	visits	her	retail	branches
this	is	because	talking	directly	with	customers	and	staff	is	the	easiest	way	to	understand	customers
first	listen	to	their	voices	and	what	they	want	to	tell
second	look	at	their	inaudible	behaviors
in	the	case	of	the	online	platform	data	will	be	used	to	determine	whether	customers	really	say	what	they	feel
apart	from	that	yim	has	to	look	into	her	business	to	see	if	there	is	anything	else	that	she	can	make	customers	happier	or	more	satisfied	than	even	customers	themselves	have	no	idea	that	they	want	it
also	she	has	to	be	customer	of	her	own	business	to	be	aware	of	problems	that	customers	encounter
this	brought	about	service	that	hamburger	studio	provides	which	is	pants	alteration
most	of	the	customers	thought	that	the	owner	of	this	brand	must	be	tall	as	the	pants	are	all	very	long	in	length
but	in	reality	the	brand	intentionally	makes	the	pants	long	for	taller	customers	and	long	pants	will	leave	some	room	for	shorter	customers	to	make	alterations
and	with	service	provided	customers	often	trust	the	shop	to	do	the	alteration	for	them
besides	there	is	an	increase	in	size	range	because	normally	if	customers	visit	the	online	or	retail	shops	and	could	not	find	clothes	of	their	size	they	will	turn	to	other	brands
so	the	brand	heeds	their	sounds	of	their	feedbacks	through	the	staff	and	improves	the	clothing	size	range
not	all	sizes	will	be	available	on	all	platforms
for	example	size	xs	will	be	available	in	the	siam	branch	because	most	of	the	customers	are	teenagers
the	sizes	available	vary	among	branches
apart	from	sizes	styles	are	also	important	because	hamburger	claims	to	be	brand	of	clothing	that	can	be	worn	for	both	working	and	parties
however	there	are	customers	who	came	to	the	store	and	especially	looked	for	party	clothing	and	the	current	style	was	still	not	the	right	answer
thus	hamburger	expanded	its	product	line	that	focuses	on	party	clothing
but	it	was	not	enough	after	expanded	their	service	and	line	of	product
hamburger	therefore	established	another	line	under	the	name	personal	that	was	created	in	response	to	customers	needs
it	provides	customize	clothing	services	with	team	of	designers	ready	to	give	the	advice	to	help	customers	enhance	their	strength	and	cover	their	flaws
this	goes	according	to	the	aim	of	the	brand	that	they	want	customers	to	wear	with	confidence
ying	from	lamoon	baby	said	that	to	understand	customers	she	has	to	go	to	customers	by	going	to	mom	and	baby	care	product	big	fair	that	are	held	times	year
she	gets	to	meet	customers	directly	and	gets	useful	insights	from	attending	every	time	because	she	will	talk	to	customers	and	observe	their	behaviors
she	will	also	ask	questions	like	how	many	children	they	have	how	old	their	children	are	whether	this	is	their	first	child	or	they	had	children	before	whether	they	have	used	her	product	what	they	like	which	products	they	are	looking	into	whether	they	like	the	product	they	are	currently	using	whether	they	have	any	problems	which	products	they	have	not	tried	which	platforms	they	use	to	purchase	why	they	turn	to	other	brands	etc
she	would	use	lot	of	questions	when	speaking	with	customers	and	often	took	time	in	their	conversation
she	gave	tasks	to	every	staff	who	went	to	the	fair	to	talk	to	customers	and	after	the	fair	was	over	they	would	hold	meeting	to	search	for	insights	and	key	ideas
not	only	can	ying	obtain	information	from	the	fair	but	she	also	gained	lot	of	information	from	online	platforms
the	brand	gives	importance	to	data	because	they	feel	that	it	will	allow	the	brand	to	win	in	every	competition
therefore	the	brand	collected	information	from	the	very	first	point	of	contact	every	transaction	that	customers	contacted	they	will	collect	information	like	name	address	date	of	birth	date	of	purchase	platform	of	purchase	product	purchased	and	amount	of	product	purchased	in	detail
after	that	they	will	further	analyze	the	information	collected	to	find	out	the	type	of	product	that	customers	are	interested	in	and	what	other	products	will	they	buy	to	do	cross	promotion	and	frequency	in	buying
so	they	will	be	able	to	identify	heavy	users	and	light	users	to	customize	each	of	them
also	they	will	be	able	to	spot	the	difference	in	consumption	behavior	of	each	customer	group	for	example	customers	from	the	northern	region	and	southern	region	have	different	consumption	behaviors	that	campaigns	and	promotions	can	be	made	differently
ying	further	said	that	nowadays	line	application	is	the	main	platform	in	selling	and	they	have	new	feature	that	she	can	put	chat	tags	for	customers	in	which	up	to	chat	tags	can	be	put	for	one	customer
as	such	she	does	not	have	to	wait	until	the	fair
she	can	immediately	ask	customers	questions	and	customize	messages	or	promotions	and	send	them	to	them
uhn	from	npp	box	specifically	stressed	the	first	impression	because	she	believed	that	first	impression	will	automatically	bring	about	second	order
what	npp	box	does	is	repeatedly	emphasize	on	brand	identity	that	they	are	friendly	like	family	easy	to	approach	and	kind
it	does	not	matter	if	customers	are	not	placing	orders
the	company	is	willing	to	give	free	consultation
also	the	phone	number	that	is	left	on	the	page	is	her	personal	number

she	only	wishes	them	well
sale	orders	are	not	the	factor	to	determine	how	her	customers	should	be	treated	and	the	brand	positions	itself	as	not	just	box	factory	but	co	creation	between	customer	and	company	because	boxes	are	the	heart	of	the	brand

they	will	pay	attention	to	frequent	questions	and	frequent	interests	and	create	content	or	products	out	of	these	frequent	questions
as	for	talking	to	the	staff	staff	members	have	to	capture	screenshots	of	chats	with	customers	and	add	them	into	respective	albums
for	example	theres	room	for	improvement	album	which	is	an	album	consisting	of	complaints	from	customers	or	an	encouragement	album	with	compliments	compiled	in	it
lastly	for	talking	to	himself	uhn	gave	the	example	of	when	she	went	out	to	shop
she	would	ask	herself	what	she	likes	and	dislikes	why	she	buys	this	brand	and	not	the	others	and	use	this	to	develop	her	product

systems	thinking	is	concept	of	biologist	named	bertalanffy
it	is	systematic	overview
with	sub	components	linked	to	larger	component
it	is	way	of	thinking	that	helps	to	understand	the	situation	in	new	light
help	anticipate	future	trends	and	plan	for	various	situations
help	anticipate	future	trends	and	plan	for	various	situations
if	this	systematic	thinking	is	used	to	analyze	the	factors	that	help	businesses	sustain	the	post	covid	crisis	there	are	four	sub	factors	that	are	linked	and	the	foundation	of	sustainable	business
people	people	knowledgeable	and	competent	employees	are	the	key	drivers	for	sustainable	business
in	this	new	normalcy	more	flexibility	in	each	role	in	the	organization	should	be	encouraged
for	example	employees	can	move	their	positions	or	switch	duties
the	organization	provides	additional	training	to	enhance	employees	skills
and	from	the	past	crisis	organizational	leaders	need	to	know	what	skills	and	knowledge	are	required	in	critical	situation	and	provide	training	for	them
so	that	employees	have	the	potential	to	be	ready	to	drive	the	organization	in	the	future	as	technology	plays	more	and	more	roles	in	work
business	owners	should	give	their	employees	the	opportunity	to	learn	more
to	be	able	to	access	modern	technology	and	apply	it	in	work	efficiently
because	human	potential	has	no	limit	the	development	promotion	and	enhancement	of	knowledge	of	employees	is	vital	force
also	known	as	asset	for	the	organization	itself
internal	process	the	redesign	of	the	internal	management	process	will	help	it	be	more	in	line	with	today	lifestyles	and	working	styles
such	as	recording	time	in	and	out	of	work	and	checking	the	work	of	employees	online	performance	evaluation	based	on	the	success	of	the	work
increasing	organizational	storage	security	standards	to	prevent	data	breaches	if	employees	have	access	to	data	from	multiple	locations
in	addition	policies	should	be	established	to	take	care	of	the	physical	mental	and	financial	health	of	employees
such	as	adding	sick	days	increasing	the	amount	of	medical	treatment	working	hours	adjustment	to	avoid	commuting	during	traffic	congestion	and	lending	to	help	improve	the	quality	of	life	of	employees
another	important	thing	is	to	develop	effective	communication	within	the	organization	by	using	modern	technology
in	order	to	be	able	to	follow	up	closely	and	to	enable	employees	to	receive	clear	and	accurate	corporate	news	at	the	right	time
finance	it	cannot	be	denied	that	the	business	will	be	sustainable	income	is	an	important	factor
after	the	business	began	to	recover	and	began	to	generate	income
business	owners	still	must	take	strong	measures	to	manage	their	finances	in	the	company
with	focus	on	cash	flow	by	reducing	unnecessary	expenses	and	hurry	to	build	the	confidence	of	customers	in	order	to	generate	continuous	income
however	business	owners	should	have	enough	cash	flow	for	at	least	three	months	of	their	anticipated	expenses
the	next	important	thing	is	financial	liquidity
business	owners	should	take	proactive	measures	in	finding	additional	sources	of	income
for	example	offering	customers	discount	if	they	can	pay	more	quickly
or	the	sale	of	assets	that	do	not	need	to	be	used	in	exchange	for	cash
in	addition	financial	risks	should	be	assessed	regularly	to	take	corrective	action	before	they	become	problem
community	of	course	part	of	the	consumers	that	are	supporting	businesses	to	grow	are	people	living	in	nearby	communities
if	you	look	at	society	that	is	dependent	on	each	other
when	people	in	the	community	help	to	buy	products	or	use	services	business	owners	can	help	give	back	to	society	in	variety	of	ways
for	example	keeping	prices	for	goods	or	services	appropriate	for	the	purchasing	power	of	consumers
production	line	modifications	to	help	produce	scarce	medical	devices
if	it	is	freight	forwarding	business	it	may	facilitate	the	delivery	of	necessary	items	to	the	community	or	to	the	healthcare	facility
or	even	simple	way	by	cooperating	with	all	anti	epidemic	measures	which	are	to	show	help	and	social	responsibility
when	society	is	supported	by	one	another	the	parties	are	working	together	to	build	strong	and	safe	community
businesses	that	are	part	of	the	community	can	continue	as	well
all	factors	whether	it	is	quality	employee	management	process	that	is	consistent	with	new	normal
concise	financial	planning
and	the	interdependence	of	the	community
they	are	all	connected	to	each	other	for	sustainable	business	development
if	the	business	owner	pays	attention	to	every	factor	regardless	of	the	situation	surely	can	maintain	business	for	sure
for	sme
when	the	business	is	successful	at	certain	level	the	entrepreneurs	should	start	planning	to	find	their	successors
this	is	crucial	plan	for	all	small	medium	and	large	businesses
one	concern	is	who	will	be	the	next	successors	and	how	to	hand	over	the	business	to	them	flawlessly
selecting	the	business	successors	is	not	to	select	people	who	are	similar	to	the	current	entrepreneurs
in	fact	it	is	to	select	those	who	are	ready	to	work	immediately	gain	acceptance	and	can	grow	into	the	future	for	the	organization
before	selecting	the	successors	start	finding	out	the	right	answers	to	the	following	questions
what	potential	should	leaders	have
some	businesses	need	leaders	with	good	personalities	while	some	need	those	who	are	capable	of	analytical	thinking	or	financial	analysis
to	identify	leader	potential	the	entrepreneurs	should	consider	business	patterns	and	organization	objectives	as	priorities
can	the	successor	work	effectively	with	the	executive	team
the	business	succession	will	be	failed	if	new	leader	handles	everything	alone	and	lacks	attention	in	the	executive	team
the	consequence	is	that	the	new	leader	cant	gain	acceptance	from	the	working	team
can	the	successor	keep	good	relationship	with	customers
this	is	significant	question	as	maintaining	relationship	with	customers	is	the	core	of	running	the	business
if	the	successor	cant	make	it	the	organization	profit	may	be	affected	and	its	business	will	be	shaky
what	issues	can	successor	get	authorization
in	some	cases	the	previous	leader	can	still	make	an	authorization	decision	on	some	issues
in	some	cases	all	authorizations	belong	to	the	successor	solely
thus	communication	should	be	thoroughly	delivered	to	concerned	parties	before	implementing	the	business	succession
are	employees	in	the	organization	ready	to	support	the	successor
this	is	another	important	question	as	the	successor	needs	acceptance	and	support	from	teamwork
if	things	dont	go	well	as	expected	the	business	succession	will	be	failed	and	the	future	of	that	business	will	then	be	at	risk
smooth	business	handover	define	precise	timing	for	the	business	handover	to	develop	the	handover	plan	appropriately	and	to	be	in	accordance	with	the	schedule
for	example	if	the	business	succession	plan	is	within	years	the	milestone	should	be	set	for	the	whole	period	of	time
besides	the	business	plan	should	cover	the	future	plan	for	the	successor	to	study	and	understand	including	policies	and	procedures	that	indicate	the	status	roles	and	of	concerned	people	in	the	business	succession
this	is	to	measure	whether	the	successor	is	qualified	for	the	position
communicate	about	the	business	succession	plan	concerned	people	like	employees	business	partners	and	customers	should	be	informed	about	the	succession	plan
communication	should	not	limit	only	an	mail	or	business	memo	meetings	among	the	executive	team	and	third	party	should	also	be	held	to	let	them	know	about	the	change	of	leader
in	some	businesses	we	may	need	to	inform	the	method	in	selecting	the	successor	to	demonstrate	transparency
for	business	that	leader	is	role	model	and	high	acceptance	an	announcement	about	the	succession	to	the	public	should	be	made	to	prevent	overwhelming	that	may	impact	the	business	sector
handover	the	business	strategically	planning	for	business	handover	is	not	easy	and	is	one	of	the	most	significant	parts	of	doing	the	business
the	current	leader	should	start	planning	this	task	ahead	of	time	to	manage	things	thoroughly	in	timely	manner	to	select	suitable	successor	and	to	ensure	that	the	organization	future	will	be	secured	in	new	leaders	hands

the	heat	is	getting	hotter	and	hotter	every	day	in	online	shopping	market	competition	that	nowadays	there	are	both	thai	and	overseas	players	in	the	market
this	creates	convenience	for	thai	peoples	spending	with	various	well	known	online	shopping	platforms	that	allow	overseas	entrepreneurs	to	easily	expand	their	market	in	thailand	as	well	as	pre	order	shops	that	can	sell	products	at	lower	price	and	receive	more	popularity
upon	hearing	it	seems	to	be	favorable	for	consumers	in	term	of	convenience	in	buying	products	that	is	much	easier	and	cheaper	than	in	the	past
on	the	other	hand	sellers	of	small	businesses	find	it	harder	to	sell	their	goods	because	their	business	rivals	come	from	all	over	the	world
therefore	they	have	to	adapt	themselves	and	strategy	to	match	the	situation
this	article	thus	will	recommend	techniques	that	help	entrepreneurs	to	keep	up	with	the	game	and	enhance	their	ability	to	compete	in	the	heating	battlefield
firstly	when	in	rome	do	as	the	romans	do
it	has	to	be	accepted	that	this	is	an	era	of	online	shopping	platform	that	purchase	is	easily	done	in	one	click
to	solely	wait	for	the	customers	to	come	to	the	shop	might	not	be	the	best	idea
entrepreneurs	should	register	an	account	for	all	platforms	because	online	platforms	do	not	require	much	cost	and	products	are	easily	sold	to	other	countries	with	the	type	of	product	clear	information	on	how	to	use	and	quality	photos	of	the	products
these	platforms	will	also	match	the	products	with	customers	searches	as	well
secondly	payment	methods	are	important	to	provide	convenience	in	payment	for	customers
there	have	to	be	as	many	channels	as	possible	because	customers	will	make	decisions	based	on	easiness	in	buying	and	smooth	payment
therefore	cash	promtpay	credit	card	debit	card	as	well	as	wallet	all	these	channels	should	be	ready
in	the	past	many	people	would	be	worried	about	transaction	systems
but	nowadays	if	one	has	registered	with	online	platforms	within	the	platforms	there	are	paid	through	credit	card	that	helps	small	business
small	businesses	will	no	longer	have	to	go	through	troubles	to	get	credit	card	readers	and	this	makes	selling	products	another	level	easier
likewise	knowing	customers	is	another	important	factor
products	that	will	be	sold	online	will	have	to	be	products	that	online	buyers	like	as	well
according	to	the	information	from	an	commerce	platform	the	spending	habit	of	online	users	in	has	shown	that	of	online	buyers	are	women	and	another	are	men
the	main	age	group	is	around	years	old	followed	by	years	old
the	products	that	is	most	popular	are	such	as	clothes	food	shoes	sports	equipment	and	traveling
fun	fact	thailand	is	the	rd	in	the	world	as	the	country	with	the	most	online	shopping
apart	from	that	consistency	is	an	important	factor	that	makes	shops	active	all	the	time
the	shops	will	have	to	always	provide	information	that	is	necessary	for	selling	through	articles	and	presentation	videos	engage	with	customers	through	various	platforms	to	ensure	customers	that	the	shops	will	always	be	here	and	can	be	trusted
the	online	shops	will	need	to	have	contact	detail	that	is	completed	and	easy	and	convenient	to	reach
the	popular	channels	are	line	facebook	page	instagram	website	online	platforms	and	contact	number
if	sellers	are	worried	that	they	cannot	reply	to	their	customers	instantly	that	it	could	cause	them	to	lose	customers	they	should	make	use	of	the	technology	to	aid	them	such	as	chatbox	program	that	helps	sellers	to	answer	customers	immediately
by	adding	sets	of	questions	and	answers	that	are	easy	to	understand	as	well	as	clear	direction	of	the	shops	style	will	help	to	reduce	cost	to	hire	the	administrator	and	reduce	the	chance	of	losing	customers
service	is	another	advantage	of	thai	sellers
they	just	have	to	diligently	answer	messages	quickly	deliver	products	on	time	have	good	service	establish	good	impression	and	make	an	online	purchase	experience	feels	like	buying	from	retail	store
overseas	stores	might	encounter	language	barrier	the	challenge	of	the	different	time	zone	that	causes	delay	of	the	reply	or	contact	number	that	is	unable	to	reach
on	the	other	hand	business	in	thailand	can	better	fulfill	those	conditions
with	excellent	service	if	the	shops	are	doing	this	duty	well	good	reviews	of	the	shops	will	appear	and	this	helps	to	reassure	other	customers	to	buy	with	the	shops
lastly	good	business	needs	reliable	partner
scb	has	been	constantly	supporting	thai	business	with	mae	manee	tunjai	loan	business	loan	for	ssme	that	creates	flow	for	online	entrepreneurs	without	needing	asset	or	surety	with	maximum	financial	limit	of	baht
with	scb	transactions	and	accept	scb	online	payment	channels	like	mae	manee	qr	code	or	edc	or	promtpay	the	interest	rate	will	be	decreased	with	repayment	period	up	to	months
register	approve	receive	money	quickly	and	conveniently	through	scb	easy	application	the	help	for	both	small	and	big	online	stores	to	make	expanding	success	possible
it	can	be	seen	that	selling	products	online	is	not	difficult	nowadays	but	it	is	also	not	easy
therefore	marketing	strategy	is	field	that	importance	should	be	given	and	more	techniques	should	be	added	to	always	look	sharp	because	this	kind	of	thing	whoever	can	adapt	first	will	grasp	the	opportunity	first
citation	for	sme
as	the	world	has	never	stopped	spinning	but	the	losing	dreamer	number	has	grown	dramatically	because	in	reality	only	few	players	could	reach	the	top
although	there	is	no	success	manual	some	elements	that	are	extracted	from	many	successful	startups	are	the	same	which	are	interesting	and	will	be	another	factor	for	anyone	who	just	started	their	first	step	to	review	which	way	they	want	to	be
beginning	with	inspiration	which	is	the	first	thing	that	everyone	ever	thinks	of	but	how	to	make	investors	dare	to	take	that	idea	risk
we	need	to	build	up	the	shape	of	the	idea
for	sme	the	first	thing	is	cool	team	because	when	investors	see	this	point	you	will	get	higher	chance	than	the	others
the	rest	is	about	being	part	of	big	good	growth	and	high	potential	market	which	is	only	contribution
if	those	two	factors	are	not	strong	enough	targeted	customer	is	needed	to	make	sure	that	your	product	or	service	can	be	sold
for	example	airbnb	the	shared	accommodation	which	started	from	changing	small	business	with	friends	joe	gebbia	and	brian	chesky	opened	their	house	to	accommodate	customers	who	could	not	find	hotel	at	the	time	of	the	high	demand	for	the	designing	conference	in	san	francisco
later	from	their	first	guest	groups	this	idea	was	blooming	after	they	received	emails	from	customers	that	were	there	places	like	this	in	other	countries
thus	they	decided	to	create	the	website	from	their	strength	of	designing	together	with	technology	experts	nate	blecharczyk
hence	they	were	ready	to	welcome	all	customers
so	far	there	is	no	need	to	explain	how	successful	airbnb	is	because	it	is	the	player	who	has	rocked	the	whole	hotel	business	and	truly	been	the	worldwide	achiever
so	talking	about	the	team	another	fact	from	the	survey	shows	some	interesting	topics	which	are
trust	and
involvement
these	are	the	principles	of	business
trust	can	be	built	regarding	many	factors	whether	graduated	from	an	accredited	university	worked	at	well	known	company	won	competition	had	experience	in	start	up	business	and	tried	many	creative	attempts	which	no	one	ever	did	for	example	coding	building	drones	before	years	old
of	high	reliable	team	has	more	than	topics	as	mentioned	involvement	means	the	team	with	direct	learning	or	has	experience	in	that	business	or	industry	for	long	time
that	means	they	know	deep	and	wide	vision	to	see	through	the	pain	points	or	can	destroy	obstacles	to	resolve	and	build	new	experience	for	customers
for	example	the	founder	of	whatsapp	chat	application	jan	koum	and	brian	acton	who	had	studied	hard	and	been	hackers	since	they	were	young
they	entered	well	known	company	as	yahoo	and	became	furious	about	the	change	of	the	company	to	focus	on	advertisements	rather	than	customers	so	they	wanted	change	and	initiated	this	application	idea
although	they	had	ever	applied	to	facebook	but	got	refused	whatsapp	is	the	achievement	that	is	built	on	their	trust	and	involvement	of	experiences
this	is	why	they	received	buying	deal	from	facebook	in	or	years	after	establishment
even	though	you	do	not	have	that	cool	teamwork	yet	paying	attention	to	the	market	and	focusing	on	targeted	customers	is	necessary
however	you	have	to	be	aware	that	markets	always	change	and	never	stay	the	same
uber	is	another	example	that	was	not	the	first	player	who	invented	new	public	transportation	market	but	it	could	steal	the	current	large	customer	base	with	the	brand	new	strategy	and	effective	user	friendly	service
no	matter	how	strong	your	team	is	or	how	effective	the	markets	are	do	not	forget	that	it	is	combination	of	inspiration	evaluation	of	possibility	and	being	able	to	change	and	be	flexible	to	face	any	happened	problem
these	are	what	you	need	to	prepare	to	be	at	the	top	of	the	chain	as	those	successful	people	have	ever	done	before
for	sme
when	you	get	lead	how	will	you	close	the	man
the	person	who	messaged	the	inbox	and	the	person	who	bought	it	may	be	different	story
khun	kritnan	wirotsailee	lek	owner	of	the	sales	page	delves	into	turn	lead	into	sales	techniques	for	generating	sales
principles	of	verbal	communication	to	close	the	sale
effectively	communicate	with	the	received	leads	solution	selling	close	the	sale	with	solution	selling	market	overview	today	is	the	market	where	consumers	make	decisions	about	purchasing	products	and	services	at	their	fingertips
especially	products	with	high	commodity	level	low	switching	cost	customers	can	easily	change	suppliers	of	goods	and	services
therefore	khun	kritnan	sees	that	the	long	term	sustainable	way	of	business	is	to	sell	solution	solution	selling
for	example	office	furniture	business
which	if	selling	the	furniture	alone	there	are	many	similar	products
and	unable	to	compete	with	large	operators	at	lower	costs
but	if	changing	the	method	from	selling	furniture	to	selling	as	solution	selling	it	solves	the	pain	point	problems	that	organizations	often	must	face
such	as	chaos	too	many	steps	difficulty	in	coordination	delays	slow	operations	long	waiting	times	by	selling	office	furniture	solution	selling	peace	of	mind	easy	fast	not	furniture	that	is	commodity	product
in	kirtmans	view	solution	selling	is	highly	flexible	strategy	that	small	business	operators	can	use	to	compete	with	larger	businesses
principles	and	order	of	presentation	of	solution	selling	identify	customer	problems	or	what	makes	customers	better	successful	sales	are	not	about	offering	advantages
product	features	feature	but	it	is	said	that	it	will	come	to	solve	the	customer	problem
how	to	make	life	better
mr	kritnan	recommends	starting	with	pain	points	which	are	of	two	types	targeting	customers	finding	pain	points	of	common	customers	in	the	industry
another	method	is	to	ask	for	pain	points	for	each	customer
present	solution	or	make	life	better	benefit	this	is	different	from	how	good	product	is
what	you	can	do	feature	by	presenting	benefit	is	technique	used	by	successful	global	salespeople
according	to	the	survey	salespeople	spend	almost	less	time	talking	about	features	than	average	salespeople
spending	more	time	talking	about	benefit	than	talking	about	features	will	make	the	presenter	look	like	brochure
annoy	the	listeners	because	these	stories	can	be	read	by	themselves
in	addition	to	benefit	there	must	be	point	of	difference
superior	to	other	competitors	if	something	is	missing	we	must	compete	on	price
this	may	cause	the	business	to	lose	in	the	purchasing	process
businesses	need	both	benefit	and	these	two	differences	must	come	together
which	will	make	customers	decide	to	buy	our	services	there	is	higher	chance	of	closing	the	sale
and	our	business	will	come	out	of	the	commodity	selling	trust	after	item	has	been	presented	most	of	the	customers	will	be	wondering	if	we	can	do	what	we	offer
khun	kritnan	suggested	solution	in	psychology	that	must	hurry	to	sell	trust	before	customers	have	doubts	because	it	will	have	huge	effect	on	the	trust	and	decision	of	the	customers
there	are	ways	to	sell	trust	reference	before	after	it	not	just	about	putting	on	the	customer	logo
but	we	need	to	find	clients	with	similar	backgrounds	to	the	clients	we	are	offering
and	try	to	tell	the	story	clearly	to	show	the	before	after	picture	see	the	real	thing	bring	sample	product	to	see

but	it	must	use	disadvantages	that	do	not	have	too	much	impact	that	leads	to	rejection	of	customers
why	don	customers	buy	from	us
one	of	the	reasons	that	customers	do	not	buy	products	from	us	caused	by	follow	up	based	on	mike	brook	collecting	statistics	on	the	side	of	the	salesperson	found	that	offered	products	and	services	but	never	followed	up	followed	once	followed	times	and	quit	followed	up
rounds
but	statistics	on	the	customer	side	show	that	of	customers	accept	the	condition	and	buy	now	buy	after	being	followed	once	buy	after	being	followed	twice	buy	after	being	followed	times	that	is	of	customers	will	buy	after	being	followed
followed	more	than	times
khun	kritnan	concluded	that	salespeople	do	not	follow	customers
as	for	the	customers	if	they	don	follow	they	don	decide	to	buy
the	heart	that	customers	do	not	buy	is	that	we	do	not	follow	customers	however	there	is	thin	line
during	the	follow	up	at	the	appropriate	level
with	pecking	until	customers	feel	bad	tracking	is	therefore	not	matter	of	quantity	alone
but	by	following	the	quality	too	according	to	the	customer	how	to	close	the	sale	the	most	important	asset	of	sales	not	only	sales	but	it	about	acquiring	loyal	customer	base	that	is	ready	to	come	back	to	buy	again	all	the	time
and	tell	others	to	come	and	buy	with	us	khun	kritnan	summed	up	the	key	to	follow	up	sales	that	still	maintain	good	customer	feelings	with	principles	as	follows	next	step	when	every	time	you	follow	customer
must	let	customers	know	before	disbanding	that	follow	up	will	occur
for	example	before	hanging	up	before	leaving	the	client	office	because	according	to	psychology	if	the	customer	knows	that	there	will	be	follow	up	customers	will	feel	welcome	but	if	they	don	let	them	know	in	advance	and	call	them
customers	will	feel	that	they	are	being	followed
next	step	customer	benefit	customers	must	receive	benefit	from	following	us	such	as	customer	convenience
this	will	increase	the	chances	of	closing	the	sale
especially	in	potential	customers	khun	krittanan	concluded	that	presenting	to	customers	starts	with	principles	solution	selling	find	customer	problems	present	solutions	build	trust
and	must	be	followed	because	in	business	model	purchasing	decisions	are	not	made	from	single	conversation	so	follow	up	and	follow	up	are	important
and	entrepreneurs	must	come	back	and	review	in	the	past	our	business	couldn	close	the	sale

nevertheless	there	are	still	some	that	many	people	perceive	and	it	is	far	from	reality
mr	ukit	tangsubkul	founder	and	ceo	of	mintedimages	co	ltd	will	then	clarify	everything	in	this	article
digital	marketing	is	not	online	selling	if	mentioning	digital	marketing	most	people	would	think	about	online	selling	on	various	online	platforms	like	websites	social	media	etc
this	is	called	commerce	which	is	part	but	not	the	whole	of	digital	marketing	because	digital	marketing	is	tool	that	allows	types	of	trading	which	are	online	trading	that	both	parties	do	not	meet	face	to	face	and	this	is	called	commerce
another	type	is	to	meet	with	the	retailer	via	online	platforms	that	bring	buyers	and	sellers	to	make	online	trading
the	latter	is	usually	used	in	business	with	high	values	like	properties	cars	etc
every	digital	marketing	tool	has	different	strengths	thus	they	have	to	be	used	together	appropriately
for	example	facebook	is	like	television	that	sends	messages	to	the	target	google	provides	information	through	search	google	map	youtube	etc
also	suitable	tools	have	to	be	used	for	particular	trading	such	as	chatbox	which	is	suitable	for	commerce	but	not	face	to	face	trading	etc
the	important	rule	of	digital	marketing	is	think	about	online	think	about	phone
every	message	will	have	to	be	suitable	for	viewing	on	phone
no	matter	if	it	is	picture	posted	on	facebook	ig	line	the	alphabetical	size	has	to	be	suitable	to	view	on	phone	and	attractive	enough	to	not	be	ignored
video	clips	will	have	to	be	in	portrait	to	be	fitting	on	the	phone
and	in	digital	marketing	the	website	is	the	most	important	core	because	apart	from	being	the	only	asset	that	entrepreneurs	possess	online	the	website	is	silent	sales	retail	stall	that	opens
if	compared	to	website	to	the	seller	good	website	needs	to	be	able	to	display	the	signature	part	of	the	product	as	much	as	possible	and	it	must	be	user	friendly
also	digital	media	has	to	be	used	to	attract	customers	to	the	website
the	secret	mechanisms	of	successful	websites	are	user	interface	ui	user	experience	ux	compatible	programming	that	is	fast	for	uploading	easy	to	update	and	responsive
all	these	will	have	to	follow	the	marketing	strategy	to	be	able	to	sell
mr	ukit	stresses	that	an	attractive	website	without	marketing	theme	can	never	sell	their	products	engagement	does	not	mean	turnover	many	people	think	that	number	of	likes	on	their	facebook	page	determines	their	sales	volume
actually	it	is	not
sometimes	the	number	of	likes	was	not	contributed	by	the	buyers
according	to	the	research	facebook	users	can	be	classified	into	groups	which	are	engager	who	clicks	and	does	nothing	else	and	watcher	who	watches	and	does	not	click
surprisingly	the	statistic	has	shown	that	the	latter	tend	to	have	more	buying	power
more	importantly	of	people	who	watch	the	advertisement	and	buy	products	will	not	click	like
therefore	social	behavior	does	not	determine	potential	buyers
tools	from	powerful	platforms	like	facebook	and	google	in	which	facebook	is	the	most	meticulous	tool	that	records	every	online	activity
besides	facebook	has	machine	learning	mechanism	that	predicts	the	future	based	on	the	past	with	data	of	people	from	half	of	the	world
this	allows	facebook	to	be	the	most	accurate	platform	to	predict	user	behavior	as	well	as	detecting	potential	customers	efficiently
facebook	can	target	groups	of	customers	which	are	core	audience	by	choosing	from	demographics	interests	behaviours	location	and	connection
the	next	group	is	custom	audience	which	is	to	show	the	advertisement	directly	to	the	target	group	based	on	personal	information	like	email	or	phone	number	or	those	who	show	interest	in	product	etc
the	last	group	is	lookalike	audience	which	is	similar	to	custom	audience	by	referring	to	the	assumption	that	people	of	similar	appearance	will	possess	similar	behavior	and	interest	and	thus	they	will	be	interested	in	the	same	product
apart	from	that	if	there	are	many	groups	of	customers	there	must	also	be	an	amendment	in	the	content	to	appeal	to	different	groups	of	people
if	unsure	of	the	result	there	can	always	be	an	testing	to	see	the	feedback
as	for	google	which	is	an	important	digital	marketing	platform	with	complete	tools	ranging	from	google	search	google	map	google	ad	youtube	gmail	and	display	network	entrepreneurs	will	have	to	do	seo	and	sem	marketing	with	several	keywords	so	that	product	will	be	displayed	when	customers	search	for	it
besides	display	network	is	tool	that	will	allow	the	banner	to	appear	on	various	websites	that	match	the	target	group	without	spending	high	cost	on	it
importantly	the	reason	that	google	becomes	powerful	digital	marketing	tool	is	that	its	capability	to	retarget	customers
when	advertisements	only	focuses	on	those	who	are	interested	the	possibility	that	the	product	will	sell	is	the	higher	and	lesser	cost	is	needed	comparing	to	randomly	spreading	the	advertisement
advertisement	to	boost	turnover	successful	digital	marketing	does	not	mean	spending	lot	of	money	on	advertisements	but	it	consists	of	mindset	skillset	and	toolset
firstly	there	must	be	correct	mindset	to	set	the	solid	and	clear	goal	user	base	conversation	revenue	etc
so	that	strategy	can	be	fixed	and	processes	can	be	planned
for	example	to	create	advertisements	on	facebook	with	an	accurate	machine	learning	system	it	has	to	be	clear	whether	engagement	total	downloading	or	awareness	is	the	goal
also	appropriate	information	should	be	given	for	the	machine	learning	system	to	find	an	accurate	result
if	the	goal	is	set	wrongly	no	matter	how	much	money	is	used	the	campaign	will	never	be	successful
once	the	principles	of	digital	marketing	are	understood	correctly	strategic	beginning	can	then	be	launched

anyway	be	reminded	that	facebook	ads	are	not	magicians	that	can	grow	sales	for	you	therere	more	important	factors	than	accurate	ads	which	are	the	product	itself	and	the	content	on	each	post
this	theory	must	start	with	excellent	content	but	your	ads	will	never	be	superb	if	the	content	is	poor
most	importantly	each	content	doesnt	need	only	engagement	because	great	content	cant	stand	alone
the	content	should	be	both	captivating	and	profitable
follow	steps	to	create	content	start	telling	what	customers	want	to	know	and	then	things	they	should	know
finally	end	up	with	an	offer	that	they	cant	refuse
telling	things	that	customers	want	to	know	and	results	or	benefits	they	will	get	from	our	products
never	jump	into	the	product	presentation	at	first
telling	what	customers	should	know	is	to	present	our	products	to	confirm	that	an	outcome	derives	from	our	communication	in	stage	that	means	our	products	deliver	good	performance	as	said

end	up	with	an	offer	that	customers	cant	refuse	you	may	close	sale	with	emotional	sentences	which	are	widely	used	such	as	if	interested	click	here	to	order	or	if	interested	send	inbox	for	more	details	etc
using	sensational	in	sentence	shows	your	deep	understanding	to	customers	for	example	selling	earrings	and	shooting	the	ads	to	men	who	have	girlfriends	and	using	this	sentence	to	close	sales	how	long	havent	you	bought	wonderful	gift	for	woman	whom	you	say	love	you	every	day
buy	earrings	that	every	woman	will	be	happy	to	receive	them
when	there	is	good	content	its	like	you	have	the	best	bullets	ready	to	shoot	the	ads
shooting	angel	ad	is	to	use	only	one	ad	for	the	whole	year
there	are	so	many	ads	to	run	throughout	the	year	but	sometimes	they	are	angels	that	grow	profits	while	some	other	times	they	are	like	normal	people	that	create	regular	sales
they	can	also	be	satan	that	once	you	shoot	them	the	loss	is	yours	and	you	need	to	close	the	business	down	for	while
factors	that	affect	profit	when	shooting	ads	on	facebook	there	are	major	groups	comprising	add	variable	and	reducer	variable
add	variable	includes	basic	factors
the	number	of	coming	in	people	through	either	inbox	or	line	or	via	phone	calls
for	example	inbox	line	and	phone	calls	making	total	of	counting	the	total	number	of	ads	from	all	campaigns	on	that	day
closing	rate
this	is	simple	step
referring	to	how	many	we	can	close	from	people
suppose	we	get	that	means	we	close	with	orders
profit	per	order	for	representative
this	is	factor	to	select	products	for	the	representative
for	those	who	shoot	the	ads	if	you	the	stock	product	at	baht	from	the	retail	price	of	baht	that	means	your	profit	per	one	item	is	baht	per	item
there	is	tricky	formula	for	setting	the	rate	of	the	selling	price
even	though	you	cant	close	sales	or	close	with	item	per	order	or	items	per	order	your	ad	budget	remains	the	same	therefore	you	should	grow	sales	as	fast	as	possible
cost	is	there	any	concern	apart	from	products
there	are	some	expenses	that	need	more	calculation
roughly	the	advertising	cost	that	we	pay	to	facebook	is	actually	hidden	costs	for	administration	fees	water	electricity	internet	office	rent	and	miscellaneous
many	businesses	go	bankrupt	because	their	budgets	dont	cover	all	costs	and	they	lack	income
anything	that	you	pay	is	considered	cost
after	knowing	variables	lets	see	how	the	formula	works
here	are	some	processes	to	create	angel	ad
tracking	create	pixel	funnel	to	collect	detailed	information
you	must	know	how	many	people	read	your	ad	completely	how	many	people	read	it	partly	which	part	of	ad	that	people	read	and	stop	reading	how	much	the	sales	cost	is	how	much	you	can	grow	sales
if	you	know	all	those	deep	information	you	can	improve	content	precisely
you	will	know	what	offers	you	should	provide	and	what	type	of	message	to	use	and	you	can	develop	the	first	two	equations	to	boost	sales	more	efficiently
the	right	offer	the	right	message	will	turn	your	ad	content	into	angel	content	which	facebook	views	as	good	content
however	no	matter	how	great	your	content	is	if	the	ad	doesnt	hit	the	right	target	it	will	not	generate	an	outcome
conversion	shooting	the	ad	with	conversion	campaign	like	arent	you	lonely	guy	who	loves	chatting	instead	of	shooting	the	ad	to	the	message	sender	you	should	shoot	the	ad	to	the	shopaholic
all	those	samples	are	ad	shot	by	the	conversion	campaign
if	you	get	information	from	pixel	funnel	you	will	set	up	conversion	campaign	in	line	with	what	you	want
the	picture	shows	how	to	set	up	and	alert	facebook	for	shooting	the	ad	to	click	purchase	which	hit	your	purpose
facebook	then	gets	the	point	that	you	need	the	real	purchaser	not	just	people	who	pop	in
so	your	equation	to	grow	sales	are	bit	more	perfect	and	you	will	gain	the	right	people	and	more	sales	accordingly
besides	your	ad	will	reach	those	who	are	really	interested	in	your	products	so	the	ad	will	score	better	as	well	as	engagement	rate
as	result	facebook	is	satisfied	with	your	ad	content	and	there	comes	an	origin	of	angel	ad	which	will	create	sales	volume	for	you	in	the	long	term
lookalike	audience	allow	facebook	to	create	target	group
the	information	from	pixel	funnel	will	provide	data	of	people	who	are	truly	interested	in	you	so	you	will	no	longer	use	your	imagination	to	create	target	group	from	interest
you	just	take	data	from	people	who	order	products	or	those	who	read	your	ad	thoroughly	and	then	create	lookalike	audience
facebook	will	be	able	to	find	group	of	people	duplicating	those	who	are	interested	in	you	such	as	creating	lookalike	audience	who	click	purchase	over	the	past	days
and	that	will	enhance	your	ad	to	run	to	the	right	people	more	accurately
at	this	stage	your	equation	to	grow	sales	is	much	stronger
retargeting	deceiving	until	its	the	right	time
even	though	there	is	an	angel	ad	not	everyone	who	sees	it	for	the	first	time	will	decide	to	purchase	products	immediately
is	that	right
think	about	the	last	time	you	saw	an	ad	and	then	ordered	product	right	away	thats	quite	rare	isnt	it
you	have	to	create	supplemental	ads	or	retargeting	ads
have	you	shot	retargeting	ad	before	and	it	didnt	work
thats	because	it	didnt	hit	the	right	target
retargeting	will	work	best	if	you	know	the	behavior	of	people	who	see	your	ad
you	will	have	their	data	by	tracking	from	pixel	funnel
in	the	first	stage	if	people	read	half	of	your	ad	and	stop	keep	shooting	the	same	ad	so	they	can	see	it	more	often
if	they	read	the	whole	ad	and	dont	purchase	products	shoot	another	ad	with	limited	time	offer	of	promotion
if	they	have	already	bought	products	shoot	ad	that	offers	special	discounts	for	exclusive	customers
when	you	retarget	the	right	people	with	the	right	message	the	repeat	ad	will	finally	reach	them	at	the	right	time
its	been	said	that	to	creating	word	of	mouth	page	or	growing	tremendous	sales	in	order	to	gain	success	comes	from	ads	and	the	rest	are	products	and	good	content	including	other	factors
however	shooting	ads	to	penetrate	our	right	target	under	reasonable	cost	should	not	be	overlooked
many	people	focus	on	increasing	the	advertising	budget	to	boost	sales
in	fact	bombarding	the	advertising	budget	is	not	the	only	factor	to	make	profit
once	you	know	how	to	create	an	angel	ad	the	right	offer	the	right	message	the	right	people	the	right	time	will	generate	an	outcome	as	sales	that	all	businesses	mostly	want

coffee	talk	series	ep	what	will	thai	smes	have	to	fight	in
join	the	trend	update	in	order	to	prepare	to	fight	the	intense	business	with	topics	that	smes	must	know	to	keep	up	and	know	quickly
both	economic	with	economics	expert	dr	yunyong	thaicharoen	first	executive	vice	president	of	the	economic	intelligence	centre	eic
followed	by	the	intense	competition	in	the	technology	world	with	isariya	paireepairit	from	blognone
culminating	with	the	understanding	of	data	to	dominate	the	minds	of	consumers	with	khun	phutthasak	tantisutthiwet	from	wisesight
the	direction	of	the	thai	economy	must	be	aggressive	or	defensive	by	dr	yunyong	thaicharoen	internal	and	external	economic	factors	affecting	business	operations
including	the	setting	of	competitive	strategies	which	consists	of	four	factors	which	are	global	economy	thai	economic	slowdown	structural	factors	and	auxiliary	factors
global	economy	heightened	external	pressures	global	economy	heightened	external	pressures	the	main	issue	affecting	the	global	economy	is	the	us	china	countermeasures	which	fight	in	dimensions	trade	war	import	taxes	increase	resulting	in	trading	in	the	world	market	to	slow	down	tech	war	the	competition	in	technology	lead	by	the	us	ban	hauwei	and	currency	war	that	china	let	the	currency	depreciate
there	are	also	geopolitical	risks	such	as	the	brexit	north	korea	protests	in	hong	kong	or	the	oil	field	in	saudi	arabia	was	bombed
all	affecting	the	world	exports	that	plummet	and	including	affecting	the	confidence	of	economists	around	the	world
which	many	countries	tend	to	negative	gdp
however	the	overall	condition	is	still	not	that	bad	because	the	service	sector	in	developed	countries	is	still	good	and	employment	is	still	strong
the	world	economy	next	year	is	likely	to	slow	down
causing	central	banks	in	many	countries	to	start	using	more	relaxed	monetary	policy	such	as	reducing	interest	rates	or	even	negative	interest	rates
including	injecting	money	into	the	system
broad	based	domestic	slowdown	the	broad	based	domestic	slowdown	in	the	thai	economy	this	year	and	next	year	it	is	expected	that	thai	gdp	will	grow	at
the	main	cause	affecting	the	thai	economy	is	the	trade	war
which	aside	from	affecting	the	slowdown	of	exports	also	affected	industrial	production	investment	and	employment
and	has	result	of	reduced	tourism	and	tourist	spending
in	addition	thai	people	spending	has	decreased	until	affecting	consumer	confidence
regarding	the	baht	strength	against	the	dollar	at
when	compared	with	competitors	it	was	found	that	in	the	past	years	the	baht	was	stronger	than	competitors	in	the	average
in	addition	tourism	declined	to	only	from	mainly	due	to	the	decline	in	chinese	tourists	and	there	are	competitors	from	other	countries	that	chinese	people	like	such	as	cambodia
in	addition	the	spending	of	chinese	tourists	is	also	reduced
partly	due	to	the	chinese	policy	that	allows	tourists	to	import	fewer	products	into	the	country	but	allowing	more	products	to	be	imported	via	commerce
businessmen	who	trade	with	china	must	adjust
in	addition	the	employment	conditions	in	the	country	are	likely	to	decrease
another	point	is	the	rising	of	household	debt	that	higher	than	other	developing	countries
the	bank	of	thailand	issued	the	ltb	measure	forcing	home	buyers	to	have	higher	down	payment
to	reduce	household	debt	but	it	will	have	an	impact	on	real	estate	businesses	that	have	already	started	to	see
including	car	sales	that	started	to	turn	negative
overall	consumer	confidence	decreased
structural	challenges	the	trend	of	automation	is	using	machinery	to	replace	more	labor
the	number	of	ot	workers	could	be	reduced	to	million
digitization	the	commerce	business	will	grow	lot	and	there	will	be	concentration	of	sales	with	the	top	large	companies	which	together	make	up	of	all	sales
the	big	companies	will	have	more	and	more	competitive	advantages
supporting	factors	the	chance	of	serious	economic	crisis	like	is	very	small
because	of	different	factors	and	situations
the	economy	will	slow	but	will	not	be	severe
because	thailand	still	has	many	good	additional	factors	meaning	that	the	reserves	are	still	large	less	foreign	debt	export	surplus	imports	lot	low	inflation
the	banks	are	ready	to	support	customers	and	have	strong	capital	funds	low	public	debt	reduced	interest	on	loans	and	lot	of	government	investment	especially	the	eec	or	eastern	economic	corridor	project
foreign	investors	come	to	invest	especially	china	who	escaped	the	trade	war	with	the	united	states
and	various	government	measures	to	stimulate	the	economy	such	as	shopping	shopping	using	government	benefits	cards	credit	guarantee	for	sme	tcg	etc
in	summary	from	all	factors	the	business	must	do	both	proactive	and	defensive	at	the	same	time
we	need	to	focus	on	the	customer	centric	technology	adoption	as	well	as	have	good	business	partners	and	partnership	network
from	the	study	it	is	found	that	different	products	and	online	sales	channels	are	also	more	likely	to	grow
although	the	economic	downturn	is	challenging	every	field	has	winners	and	losers
winners	must	be	flexible	take	good	care	of	finances	have	enough	working	capital
must	adjust	the	plan	quickly	make	advance	decisions	based	on	the	information	and	take	good	care	of	the	customers	that	are	important	to	the	business
foreign	technology	the	dangers	or	opportunities	of	thai	smes	by	isariya	paireepairit	blognone	various	applications	that	we	are	used	to	whether	social	media	such	as	facebook	instagram	twitter	youtube	all	are	american	apps	and	line	which	are	from	japan
if	turning	to	look	at	the	large	commerce	apps	that	dominate	throughout	thailand	such	as	lazada	and	shopee	behind	the	scenes	is	an	commerce	war	to	usurp	consumers	by	burning	money
multi	billion	dollar	level	between	the	two	major	chinese	companies	alibaba	and	tencent	fought	through	agents
of	course	this	battlefield	is	very	intense
players	who	do	not	have	enough	money	to	die	and	fall	as	well
delivery	apps	or	delivery	services	that	we	use	regularly	to	deliver	our	favorite	dishes	whether	grab	get	ljne	man	or	foodpanda
there	is	no	player	that	belongs	to	thailand	because	it	belongs	to	malaysia	indonesia	japan	and	germany	respectively
which	makes	it	difficult	for	new	companies	with	less	capital	to	compete
now	grab	is	partnering	with	central	and	other	companies
make	it	possible	to	raise	large	fund
the	delivery	apps	business	is	business	called	or	online	to	offline
and	of	course	these	digital	business	models	will	yield	huge	losses	at	first	to	beat	competitors	buy	market	share	and	hope	to	monopolize	the	market	in	the	long	term	to	be	able	to	determine	the	price	in	the	future
logistic	apps	are	no	different	because	the	big	players	in	the	market	whether	kerry	flash	lalamove	or	scg	are	foreign	whether	kerry	is	from	big	company	from	hong	kong	or	scg	in	partnership	with	japan
leaving	only	the	thai	post	that	is	the	owner	of	true	thai	nationality
all	the	different	types	of	applications	that	we	have	seen	will	see	that	the	big	owners	that	dominate	the	market	are	entirely	foreign
there	are	only	payment	apps	that	thai	companies	can	still	compete
almost	all	of	these	are	the	payment	apps	of	the	bank	whether	scb	kbank	krungsri	ktb	or	bbl	which	shows	that	thai	banks	are	strong	enough	to	be	able	to	consume	external	capital	flows
when	the	situation	is	like	this	where	are	the	chances	of	thai	people
because	foreign	money	is	huge	and	in	terms	of	technology	he	is	far	ahead	of	us
the	technology	business	is	collective	market
we	don	see	anyone	able	to	compete	with	google	or	facebook
only	number	one	can	survive
therefore	the	competitive	opportunities	of	thai	smes	are	to	find	gaps	and	must	adjust	to	get	examples	of	thai	smes	that	see	business	gaps	and	can	adjust	to	compete	for	such	as	jib	is	thai	commerce	that	can	survive	in	this	era
an	online	computer	shop	that	offers	free	hour	delivery
deliver	products	to	your	hands	within	hours	which	the	main	products	are	game	products	that	are	high	value	high	growth	products
another	example	of	building	material	like	onestockhome	commerce	that	finds	its	niche
by	focusing	on	selling	construction	materials	like
and	wongnai	not	just	restaurant	review	apps	but	is	also	partnering	with	the	lineman
there	are	also	other	apps	restaurant	management	system	rms	for	small	restaurants	to	accept	orders	and	send	to	lineman	to	help	stores	take	orders	more	efficiently
all	are	examples	that	show	that	thai	smes	that	can	adapt	and	see	the	gap	to	play	at	the	big	platform	has	not	come	down	to	make	and	apply	technology	to	the	business	well	can	still	compete	and	survive
the	world	changed	customers	changed	fought	with	consumer	insight	by	phutthasak	tantisutthiwet	factors	that	can	make	business	decision	in	the	digital	age	successful	are	data	insight	personalized	experience	be	real
out	of	items	require	all	data
but	the	question	is	how	can	we	use	data	to	succeed
good	products	and	services	must	understand	and	meet	customer	needs
must	have	measurement	data
must	have	passion	for	business	and	must	be	able	to	use	the	information	available	for	business	benefits
pwc	says	that	companies	that	use	data	to	make	well	informed	decisions	will	be	able	to	develop	their	business	times	better	than	other	companies
but	now	of	executives	still	use	personal	experience	and	opinions	to	make	decisions	in	fact	we	are	always	with	data
when	there	are	enough	customers	the	shop	owner	or	the	person	in	front	of	the	store	who	meets	regular	customers	should	be	able	to	guess	what	the	original	customers	will	order
this	is	data
it	just	data	that	has	been	accumulated	in	terms	of	an	experience	only	that	person	can	use	and	make	decision
the	good	thing	about	modern	data	is	that	it	makes	the	experience	tangible	that	others	can	understand
allowing	people	with	only	two	years	of	work	experience	to	be	able	to	make	decisions	like	those	who	work	for	ten	years	or	at	least	similarly	are	important
therefore	allowing	employees	to	enter	their	experience	into	data	is	very	useful
but	consumers	in	the	digital	age	are	complex
the	modern	consumers	sometimes	just	want	to	enjoy	the	social	world
in	this	era	if	you	think	it	is	normal	you	may	not	be	able	to	catch	up	with	new	things	on	social	media
because	consumers	today	are	having	fun	and	have	their	own	personality
data	will	tell	us	parts	say	what	they	think	say	what	they	did
for	example	if	we	ask	customers	who	come	to	eat	at	the	restaurant	whether	the	food	is	delicious	or	not	they	say	it	is	delicious	but	the	food	is	still	lot	in	the	dish
we	must	take	it	back	to	analyze
therefore	to	understand	consumers	well	both	parts	must	be	combined
but	most	of	the	digital	information	is	at	the	top	of	the	iceberg	that	we	see	is	what	they	do
for	example	using	google	analytics	we	know	the	behavior	of	what	they	are	doing
but	we	don	know	what	he	thinks	like	knowing	that	he	likes	knowing	that	he	is	sharing	but	does	not	know	why	he	likes	why	does	he	share
social	media	research	is	combination	of	information	and	ideas
by	collecting	information	on	social	media	that	is	only	public	information
social	media	research	will	divide	the	method	of	data	collection	into	the	core
the	horizontal	axis	is	divided	into	active	ask	and	passive	do	not	ask
the	vertical	axis	is	qualitative	data	and	quantitative	data
an	active	approach	is	qualitative	data	such	as	asking	for	focus	group	or	questionnaire	for	passive	ie	waiting	for	data	to	float	up	such	as	sticking	to	see	behaviors	such	as	where	people	like	to	sit	in	how	to	shop	in	and	out	or	use	observation
normally	information	from	social	listening	is	passive
the	meaning	goes	in	and	wait	and	see	what	people	are	saying	listening	and	processing	what	is	the	pros	and	cons
most	of	the	information	obtained	is	qualitative	about	what	people	say
but	when	working	it	will	count	how	many	times	someone	has	talked	about	it	to	come	out	as	quantitative	number
therefore	they	have	mixed	data	both	quality	and	quantity	which	helps	to	understand	consumers	better
sometimes	what	he	says	himself	may	be	something	we	don	expect
which	made	other	interesting	issues	even	more
what	does	social	data	say
examples	of	eco	cars	if	asked	by	the	brand	will	think	that	people	want	to	know	about	fuel	efficiency	car	size	beauty	and	price
but	it	turns	out	that	on	social	media	people	talk	about	performance	and	after	sales	service
because	the	point	is	people	who	will	buy	eco	cars	they	already	know	that	the	price	must	be	cheap	must	save	fuel	as	small	car
therefore	when	they	already	knew	all	this	information	when	talking	on	social	media	would	like	to	know	about	other	things	such	as	this	small	car	can	drive	to	upcountry
because	teenagers	who	buy	cars	of	this	size	still	have	passion	and	want	to	travel
so	it	became	talk	about	performance
and	after	sales	service	is	the	cost	that	must	be	paid	after	the	purchase
if	asked	are	there	any	brands	that	speak	these	two	stories
there	are	some	performance	issues	but	after	sales	service	almost	no	one	talks
data	science	may	be	good	at	data
but	may	not	understand	the	business	and	do	not	understand	the	nature	of	the	product
for	example	have	men	do	research	on	lipstick	colors	that	women	use	may	not	be	as	good	as	women	do	because	men	don	understand	the	product
data	creation	is	not	only	good	in	data	but	must	understand	the	business	as	well	must	analyze	the	data	of	the	business	character
data	creators	must	collaborate	closely	with	the	business
business	person	must	give	enough	information	to	the	data	maker
don	think	that	they	are	good	at	everything
information	is	map	that	will	take	us	in	the	right	direction
the	decision	does	not	require	information
we	have	no	way	to	know	of	the	information
and	importantly	we	can	wait
if	we	kept	waiting	we	couldn	catch	up
just	have	about	enough	data	to	try
and	at	least	we	do	not	fall
just	have	about	of	the	information	and	then	decide
trying	and	learning	and	then	gradually	adjust
ask	the	right	questions	and	get	the	right	data
try	to	reduce	judgment	and	then	coordinate	with	more	data	people	will	be	able	to	use	data	to	create	magic	for	their	business
know	quickly	and	broadly	to	see	opportunities	in	doing	business	that	meets	the	needs	of	the	digital	age	customers
flexible	adaptable	and	have	good	partners	is	survival	path	for	thai	smes
want	to	gain	more	knowledge	and	update	business	trends
meet	us	at	the	scb	business	center	which	has	good	knowledge	and	many	good	assistants	to	help	thai	smes	grow	and	move	forward	together
for	sme
amid	the	economic	hardships	caused	by	covid	homegrown	food	delivery	platform	for	the	thai	people	has	been	created	by	the	scb	group	motivated	by	the	groups	strong	determination	to	support	society	by	helping	to	lower	the	cost	of	living	particularly	for	those	preferring	to	dine	at	home
with	food	delivery	services	gaining	in	popularity	scb	came	up	with	the	idea	of	creating	robinhood	food	delivery	application	inspired	by	the	securities	trading	firm	of	the	same	name	that	does	not	charge	service	fees
employing	the	same	concept	the	new	food	delivery	platform	will	not	charge	any	subscription	gp	gross	profit	or	other	fees
eateries	will	be	able	to	recoup	the	full	amount	of	their	costs	allowing	them	to	sell	better	quality	food	and	offer	larger	portions
customers	benefit	by	paying	the	actual	food	and	delivery	costs	without	extra	charges
the	platform	also	allows	shop	owners	easier	and	quicker	access	to	loans
scb	robinhood	food	delivery	gp	the	scb	groups	new	generation	team	was	tasked	with	building	the	application
normally	project	of	this	type	would	take	at	least	six	to	twelve	months	to	develop
however	by	using	existing	bank	resources	such	as	its	robust	technology	infrastructure	its	mae	manee	project	restaurant	network	the	resources	of	close	partner	google	my	business	and	the	delivery	messengers	of	the	banks	business	partner	skootar	the	application	was	completed	in	just	three	months	and	new	partners	are	being	continually	added
this	approach	enabled	scb	to	effectively	lower	its	costs	unlike	other	new	startups
as	part	of	the	scb	group	robinhood	will	speed	up	payment	with	goal	of	sellers	receiving	their	money	within	one	hour	after	closing	an	order
payments	will	be	credited	to	both	sellers	and	delivery	messengers	automatically	via	the	digital	system	without	any	cash	involved
in	revealing	the	new	service	platform	scb	company	chairman	of	the	board	of	directors	mr	arthid	nanthawithaya	said	that	robinhood	was	not	created	to	compete	with	anyone	and	does	not	seek	to	dominate	the	market
instead	it	was	developed	from	customer	centric	perspective	focusing	on	creating	favorable	experience	without	any	target	customer	numbers
we	want	to	make	it	another	alternative	for	society
realizing	our	advantages	we	hope	that	more	and	more	restaurants	will	be	joining	us
the	project	was	initiated	as	csr	activity	for	good	cause	and	the	scb	group	does	not	earn	any	profit	from	this	activity
if	the	platform	meets	the	requirements	of	sellers	and	buyers	and	has	sufficiently	expanded	its	customer	base	we	could	expand	it	beyond	just	food	delivery	in	the	future
we	are	keen	to	make	it	digital	platform	that	will	engage	our	customers	closely	and	persuade	them	to	spend	more	time	on	the	application
finally	if	the	platform	proves	popular	project	owner	and	scb	company	purple	ventures	has	its	own	business	model	that	will	allow	it	create	spin	offs	that	generate	revenue	from	other	services	such	as	providing	loans	to	platform	members	which	will	be	independent	from	food	ordering	or	delivery	fees
the	robinhood	application	is	scheduled	to	be	launched	in	july
at	its	inception	there	will	be	some	eateries	listed	on	the	platform
transaction	volume	will	depend	on	the	customer	experience	and	the	bank	hopes	to	receive	positive	response	from	those	who	enjoy	the	experience
services	will	be	available	nationwide	but	will	primarily	cover	bangkok	and	vicinity
interested	eateries	can	apply	free	of	charge	from	now	on	by	calling	tel
between	hrs
or	visiting	scb	branches	in	bangkok	and	its	surrounding	areas
the	scb	group	is	ready	to	stand	by	thai	society	under	every	circumstance
the	bank	firmly	believes	that	with	its	strong	determination	and	readiness	to	adapt	quickly	thai	society	can	join	together	and	progress	even	further	with	our	strong	spirit
crises	will	turn	into	opportunities	allowing	everyone	to	adjust	transform	and	overcome	obstacles	and	boundaries	in	order	to	go	on	to	accomplish	things	never	accomplished	before	and	to	lead	thai	society	to	sustainability	in	the	new	normal	era
pin	shop	for	customers	to	find
shenzhen	was	known	among	thai	people	as	the	gate	to	mainland	china	from	hong	kong	and	popular	shopping	place	for	grade	products
however	nowadays	whoever	visits	shenzhen	will	be	thrilled	with	the	scene	of	modern	big	city	that	is	heading	towards	becoming	high	tech	city
this	article	will	introduce	readers	to	shenzhen	in	the	st	century	that	is	even	bestowed	nickname	of	silicon	valley	of	china
from	fishing	village	to	big	city	going	back	to	years	ago	shenzhen	was	just	small	city	near	the	shoreline
it	was	border	between	mainland	china	and	hong	kong
but	when	president	deng	xiaoping	visionary	leader	who	practiced	liberal	market	to	improve	the	economy	in	china	and	the	man	who	came	up	with	the	quote	it	doesn	matter	whether	cat	is	black	or	white	as	long	as	it	catches	mice	its	good	cat	opened	the	southern	coastal	city
he	turned	it	into	the	special	economic	zone	in	to	prepare	for	foreign	investment
among	the	first	special	economic	zones	namely	shenzhen	zhuhai	shantou	and	xiamen	shenzhen	is	located	on	the	pearl	river	delta
it	has	developed	leaps	and	bounds	from	an	agricultural	city	the	fishing	village	with	population	of	less	than	people	into	the	worlds	leading	technological	city	with	more	than	million	population
phases	to	become	high	end	producer	from	up	to	the	present	shenzhen	divided	its	development	into	stages	which	are	phase
this	phase	focused	mainly	on	using	manpower	for	development
as	one	of	the	special	economic	zones	many	businesses	from	hong	kong	invested	in	shenzhen	holding	it	as	fort	for	production	starting	from	basic	industrial	production	and	later	on	the	electronic	and	information	industry
this	made	shenzhen	part	of	the	worlds	manufacturing	chain	and	paved	their	way	to	innovative	technology	and	high	end	technological	product
as	there	were	transnational	investments	there	was	surge	of	workforce	from	other	regions	of	the	country	entering	shenzhen	and	it	also	caused	shenzhen	to	expand	rapidly
there	were	residential	development	and	various	facilities	such	as	port	power	plant	road	communication	etc
phase
in	this	decade	shenzhen	had	become	business	city	and	there	were	more	business	owners	which	were	the	results	of	becoming	socialist	market	economy	and	financial	innovation
at	the	same	time	there	was	change	in	the	structure	of	the	electronic	industry	in	the	world
all	these	resulted	in	investment	and	technology	from	big	international	companies	upgrading	shenzhens	manufacturing	industry	from	focusing	on	using	manpower	to	capital	and	high	technology	such	as	communication	devices
in	the	worlds	manufacturing	aspect	shenzhen	developed	from	lower	to	lower	medium	and	in	this	phase	there	was	growth	in	the	high	tech	industry	logistics	and	finance	by	local	entrepreneurs	as	well
phase
shenzhen	had	made	significant	change	when	the	whole	of	china	changed	its	economic	system	into	socialist	market	economy
as	result	shenzhen	did	not	have	any	advantage	from	being	the	special	economic	zone	anymore
besides	the	city	was	faced	with	lack	of	resources	like	land	energy	and	water	from	the	increasing	population
therefore	shenzhen	found	need	to	establish	new	strength	by	promoting	innovation
in	the	production	aspect	there	was	promotion	of	strategic	industries	such	as	biotechnology	the	internet	new	energy	new	generation	it	etc
this	pushed	shenzhen	to	have	its	place	in	the	worlds	lower	medium	production	in	chain
and	during	phase	in	these	recent	years	shenzhen	had	successfully	entered	the	developing	stages	that	were	driven	by	innovation	and	risen	to	the	top	in	the	worlds	manufacturing	chain
with	the	effect	of	the	policy	to	promote	systematic	innovative	technology	shenzhen	was	able	to	have	an	ecosystem	capital	and	talents
also	together	with	the	basic	structure	conducive	environment	for	innovative	development	growth	of	start	up	and	budget	shenzhen	was	able	to	establish	new	innovative	manufacturing	that	was	able	to	attract	resources	from	the	global	stage
this	can	be	seen	from	that	the	number	of	high	tech	products	increased	times	grew	yearly	from	billion	yuan	to	billion	yuan
this	was	accounted	for	of	the	gdp
moreover	more	than	companies	that	are	located	in	shenzhen	have	invested	in	more	than	countries	in	every	region	globally
this	includes	famous	brands	like	huawei	zte	cimc	and	byd	that	are	leaders	in	technological	innovation	and	have	expanded	their	business	and	production	all	over	the	world
becoming	high	technology	city	of	the	east	from	the	fishing	village	in	the	past	with	consistent	policy	that	promotes	technology	like	ai	policy	shenzhen	of	today	is	being	referred	to	as	silicon	valley	of	china	because	it	is	the	home	to	leading	chinese	tech	company	like	huawei	the	big	producer	of	network	hardware	and	communicating	devices	tencent	social	platform	wechat	qq	byd	the	manufacturer	of	electronic	cars	bgi	bio	science	researcher	dji	the	drone	and	aerial	technology	as	well	as	foreign	tech	company	like	sensetime	ai	business	from	hong	kong
lately	tencent	has	megaproject	plan	to	build	net	city	the	future	city	on	an	area	of	more	than	million	meter	square	that	is	going	to	be	where	its	research	and	development	center	is	and	it	will	also	be	residential	area
the	special	part	of	this	project	would	be	that	it	is	city	that	urban	lifestyle	and	nature	will	be	blended	together	with	the	emphasis	on	the	green	area	bicycle	lane	park	and	there	will	be	no	usage	of	cars	that	all	will	be	connected	to	public	transport
nevertheless	many	analysts	think	that	shenzhen	will	gradually	gain	more	importance	with	its	readiness	in	both	software	and	hardware
this	differs	from	silicon	valley	of	usa	that	their	only	forte	is	software
also	before	this	the	chinese	government	had	announced	the	trial	of	using	digital	yuan	money	and	shenzhen	is	one	of	the	first	trial	cities	to	use	digital	yuan	as	well	as	the	worlds	first	city	to	try
now	all	eyes	on	shenzhen	city	of	technology	of	the	east	that	has	risen	to	become	one	of	the	global	innovation	centers	making	made	in	china	products	not	so	simple	anymore

from	poor	girl	to	global	fashion	brand	executive	differcult	life	led	her	into	business	path	just	to	want	to	make	money	to	send	herself	to	study
that	the	beginning	of	strong	female	ceo	named	khun	kornkanok	sawangruamchok	khun	po	of	shu	global	company	limited
fashion	brand	that	wins	the	hearts	of	both	thai	and	international	customers
khun	por	said	started	doing	fashion	brands	when	was	student	at	chulalongkorn	university
by	designing	products	to	be	sold	in	various	stores	and	saving	money	until	being	able	to	open	her	own	shop	when	he	was	in	the	fourth	year
but	then	running	business	is	like	playing	rollercoaster
with	both	ups	and	downs	in	khun	po	met	another	test
that	is	heavy	to	the	point	that	it	is	almost	ruined	only	months	of	business	working	capital	left
then	expanded	branches	throughout	siam	but	then	came	the	test	of	strength
when	the	economic	crisis	store	sales	fall	plus	there	are	people	copying	the	products	to	sell	so	they	find	way	out	by	copying	their	own	products
and	sell	them	at	lower	price	until	the	business	can	revive	again
worse	yet	an	accident	broke	his	ankle
causing	to	design	shoes	for	self	healing	even	if	the	sky	is	dark	but	there	is	also	light	the	self	healing	shoe	became	the	birthplace	of	sofa	shu	shu	global	signature	shoe	which	accounted	for	of	the	brand	total	revenue
how	to	build	brand	to	be	popular	and	famous	among	celebrities	the	origin	of	the	creation	of	the	shu	global	brand	khun	por	said	that	the	aim	of	building	brand	is	to	make	shu	be	loved	by	everyone
and	everyone	loves	the	essence	of	shu
the	essence	of	shu	is	that	we	will	be	sensational	empowering	and	you	can	miss

beverage	as	well
khun	por	also	said	that	to	build	brand	to	the	international	level
strategy	is	required
for	example	making	special	edition	shoes	for	world	class	celebrities	to	use
or	sending	shoes	to	celebrities	to	try	on	without	any	cost	it	like	bartering	between	each	other
the	secret	that	makes	world	class	celebrities	agree	to	wear	shu	shoes	is	products	must	be	good	and	meet	the	requirements
have	an	ingenious	negotiation	technique	pay	attention	to	the	packaging	and	use	pr	firm	abroad
in	summary	what	makes	it	possible	to	overcome	obstacles	is	to	build	strong	brand	positioning	clearly	what	the	identity	of	the	brand	is	which	will	make	free	from	price	wars
have	more	sales	beautiful	can	choose	can	choose	who	to	do	business	with	attractive	to	investors	and	customer	royalty	perspectives	of	female	ceos	in	the	fashion	industry	as	person	who	built	his	own	business	since	his	school	days	being	ceo	has	something	to	challenge	all	the	time

standing	in	business	where	men	are	quite	strong	it	forces	us	to	constantly	develop	ourselves
although	most	men	have	good	logical	thinking	women	also	have	emotional	intelligence	as	an	advantage	in	dealing	with	difficult	issues	if	they	have	different	opinions	about	work
we	must	have	straightforward	discussion	about	ego	reduction	in	order	to	achieve	the	best	results	in	the	business	world

ecommerce	is	huge
at	present	there	are	more	than	million	kols	with	live	selling	accounts	and	million	accounts	selling	live	for	more	than	hours	day
that	means	kol	is	regular	job	that	generates	substantial	income
and	it	great	way	to	sell	products	to	business	owners
therefore	the	kol	in	china	is	powerful	influencer	in	decision	making
you	can	choose	to	accept	or	not	accept	the	product	to	live	and	sell
khun	mint	has	summarized	from	direct	experience	rules	that	will	make	kol	live	sell	things	in	china

incentive	commission	of	successful	conversion	rates	how	to	make	your	work	happy	and	your	family	happy
as	single	mother	with	three	children	khun	mint	said	that	despite	working	like	crazy	from	monday	to	friday
but	having	to	take	on	the	role	of	mother	every	day	especially	on	saturdays	and	sundays	will	try	to	be	with	the	children	and	family	and	will	not	apply	other	people	norms	or	standards	of	work	life	balance	to	themselves
but	to	focus	on	family	and	myself	by	using	the	criteria	that	are	measured	by	waking	up	each	day
we	will	always	be	able	to	have	smile	for	ourselves
have	positive	energy	for	our	loved	ones	that	is	work	life	balance	in	the	style	of	khun	mint	for	khun	por	she	said	that	admit	that	nowadays	still	don	have	work	life	balance	because	am	speeding	up	my	business
because	they	do	not	know	what	will	happen	to	themselves	in	the	future	therefore	want	to	accomplish	everything	while	still	have	energy
therefore	try	to	blend	work	into	my	lifestyle
there	is	mindset	that	work	is	not	work
and	will	make	yourself	not	feel	tired	and	when	have	time	will	be	full	with	my	child
raising	children	will	focus	on	mindset
if	child	has	good	mindset	doing	anything	will	be	fine	when	asked	if	as	ceo	he	had	to	send	power	to	his	subordinates
as	mother	have	to	give	power	to	my	child
and	if	you	are	born	exhausted	what	will	you	do
khun	por	said	in	the	past	have	never	been	discouraged	because	knew	that	every	problem	has	solution
but	if	they	can	find	way	out	they	ll	let	go
then	start	again	but	admit	that	there	are	times	when	physically	and	mentally	tired	because	the	body	deteriorates	with	age
if	something	is	not	understood	it	will	continue	to	learn
for	example	not	good	at	people	skill	fix	it	by	going	to	training	course
to	bring	up	the	potential	of	the	team	maybe	if	other	people	can	adjust	adjusted	to	their	own	point	of	view	try	looking	on	the	other	side	to	see	different	view	instead
as	khun	mint	said	the	team	teaches	us	the	japanese	norm	called	wabi	sabi
let	us	enjoy	the	little	things	every	day	be	thankful	for	things
around	us	it	will	invigorate	the	mind
khun	mint	will	tell	herself	that	don	be	stressed
you	can	smile	like	crazy	sometimes
secretly	be	happy	with	the	little	things	every	day
stay	with	yourself
eat	until	you	are	full
talk	to	your	close	friends
nothing	is	easy	or	difficult	in	life	it	depends	on	the	point	of	view
looking	negative	looking	positive	is	okay
but	in	the	end	we	must	smile	to	ourselves
and	love	yourself	more	and	more	every	day
when	years	old	where	do	you	want	to	see	yourself
what	do	you	do
khun	mint	told	about	note	that	changed	my	mind	forever
one	of	the	managers	wrote	me	note	saying	khun	mint	has	done	her	best
want	khun	mint	to	feel	proud	of	herself	now
want	khun	mint	to	try	to	release	small	identity
of	yourself	out	because	small	piece	of	paper	that	day	makes	you	mint	feel	like	you	ve	been	reborn
because	all	my	life	have	done	everything	for	others
do	whatever	you	want	without	having	to	care	about	anyone	voice	and	as	mother	want	my	children	to	be	proud	of	us
my	goal	is	to	want	to	leave	this	world	while	my	child	can	take	care	of	himself
then	we	can	help	others	as	much	as	we	can
who	knows	or	doesn	know	it	doesn	matter	khun	por	said	want	to	be	someone	who	gives	others	the	opportunity	to	grow
want	to	create	an	old	person	who	has	been	with	us	for	long	time
by	developing	his	potential	to	step	up	to	higher	point
because	nowadays	the	company	is	growing	very	fast
causing	to	look	for	new	people	to	strengthen	the	army	but	the	old	people	must	not	abandon	them
how	to	upskill	the	old	one
continue	to	develop
this	is	what	want	to	achieve
although	khun	por	and	khun	mint	are	ceos	in	different	businesses
different	industries	but	there	is	one	thing	they	have	in	common	strong	leadership
ready	to	face	problems	and	obstacles	with	growth	mindset	that	is	optimistic
believe	that	you	can	fall	and	get	up
believe	in	people	potential	and	have	heart	that	wants	to	share	ready	to	help	others	this	is	something	that	can	be	felt	from	the	perspectives	and	ideas	of	these	two	talented	and	strong	female	ceos

when	the	product	became	known	among	chinese	tourists	khun	banpot	then	finds	an	opportunity	to	return	to	the	chinese	market	again
although	the	bird	nest	market	in	china	is	red	ocean	but	with	continued	strong	branding	until	the	product	has	been	entrusted	to	entertain	important	people	who	visit	china	including	important	chinese	people	until	the	product	is	finally	widely	accepted
flag	cross	border	commerce	business	in	china	when	thinking	of	doing	business	in	china	at	first	khun	banpot	wanted	to	enter	tmall	global	because	he	had	the	no
market	share	but	since	it	was	still	small	business	and	the	product	was	not	yet	known	he	started	opening	flagship	store	at	jd	global	first
when	the	product	sells	well	tmall	global	is	persuaded	to	sell	it	making	it	mainly	through	these	platforms
and	because	want	to	close	the	risk	therefore	looking	for	other	sales	channels	so	trying	to	sell	offline
but	due	to	insufficient	study	and	complex	regulations	in	china	it	was	not	as	expected
but	with	effort	finally	found	solution	by	registering	company	in	guangzhou
to	open	contract	manufacturing	company	in	china	allowing	the	fda	or	china	fda	to	be	able	to	wholesale	bird	nests	to	china
when	company	produces	its	own	products	in	china	reduce	production	costs	such	as	lower	packaging	costs	have	tax	advantages	this	made	it	possible	to	open	shop	in	china	and	have	channel	for	distributors	successfully	factors	that	make	thai	products	famous	crossing	over	to	china	khun	banpot	thinks	that	in	the	past	years	the	export	of	thai	products	to	china	has	boomed	which	has	factors	that	caused	this	trend
exchange	student	group	most	of	them	come	to	study	in	thailand	and	want	to	stay
so	thought	of	doing	business	to	find	thai	products	to	sell	in	china	such	as	cosmetics	fruits
when	this	group	of	people	started	having	money	they	hired	oems	to	produce	their	own	brands	or	set	up	factory	to	produce	products	in	thailand	and	then	wholesale	them	back	to	china
tourism	industry	in	the	past	chinese	tour	groups	came	to	thailand	at	very	low	prices
causing	lot	of	chinese	people	to	visit	thailand	resulting	in	chinese	people	knowing	more	about	thai	products
soft	power	thailand	captures	the	heart	of	the	dragon	land	thai	movies	and	dramas	are	popular	in	china	such	as	wife	making	chinese	people	want	to	follow	in	thailand	footsteps
government	support	for	tourism	as	result	there	are	million	chinese	tourists	coming	to	thailand	per	year
how	to	prepare	before	entering	the	race	product	law	and	regulation	take	trademark	in	china	you	should	take	picture
should	jot	down	chinese	text	and	write	it	comprehensively
if	you	have	chinese	name	write	down	your	chinese	name	because	the	thai	name	in	your	passport	is	in	english
how	do	chinese	authorities	know	they	are	the	same	person

through	apps	for	chinese	people	in	thailand	such	as	sun	wukong	app	chang	bin	app	chinese	associations	in	thailand	can	extend	their	business	to	china	because	they	have	connections	with	traders	in	china
you	don	have	to	go	to	the	fair	very	often
if	you	go	it	to	test	the	market	listen	to	feedback
commerce	traditional	commerce	is	online	sales	where	buyers	have	demand	for	products	then	search	for	and	buy	products	or	called	demand	search	purchase	model	including	taopao	tmall	jd	com
social	commerce	is	the	integration	of	social	media	and	online	shopping	together	gaining	trust	from	knowing	on	social	media	and	leading	to	product	trading	between	each	other	or	called	trust	demand	purchase	such	as	pinduoduo	xiaohongshu	wechat	mall	mini	product	etc

top	social	media	in	china	wechat	line	whatapp	tencent	qq	weibo	twitter	douyin	tiktok	xiao	hongshou	ig	businesses	who	want	to	do	cross	border	commerce	in	china	opening	the	flag	ship	store	on	various	platforms	of	china	itself	makes	it	difficult	to	understand	the	process	but	it	quite	cumbersome
find	an	exclusive	partner
the	advantage	is	that	you	don	have	to	sell	big	lots
find	partner	that	is	already	selling	on	the	platform
the	advantage	is	that	you	have	many	partners
exporting	thai	products	with	cbec	is	therefore	golden	opportunity	for	thai	entrepreneurs	to	export	their	products	to	the	chinese	market	without	having	to	go	through	strict	regulations
therefore	it	is	another	channel	that	should	not	be	missed	to	increase	the	opportunity	to	expand	the	customer	base

for	sme
an	internist	who	goes	by	the	pen	name	of	boy	who	does	not	play	football	during	lunch	explained	the	origin	of	his	pen	name	that	during	his	secondary	school	years	his	friends	always	invited	him	to	play	football	during	lunch
he	himself	wanted	to	join	them	on	the	field	but	he	was	not	good	at	playing	football	so	he	could	only	wait	at	the	sideline
until	he	graduated	from	secondary	school	life	after	that	does	not	consist	of	playing	football	at	lunch	anymore
he	thus	uses	this	pen	name	to	remind	himself	of	what	he	once	wanted	to	do	but	he	did	not	and	let	that	one	moment	in	life	slipped	through	his	fingers
now	dr	kanapon	phumratprapin	or	dr	tum	who	has	the	above	mentioned	pen	name	chooses	not	to	hesitate	to	do	whatever	he	wants	to	do
he	opens	start	up	company	despite	having	stable	job	as	physician	in	the	hospital
he	chooses	to	follow	his	heart	when	the	opportunity	appears	before	his	eyes
it	was	decision	made	at	the	right	situation	and	time	that	brings	about	start	up	business	called	health	at	home	to	drive	the	future	of	healthcare	forward	and	create	more	options	for	the	nations	healthcare
the	beginning	of	health	at	home	dr	tum	likes	taking	care	of	patients	overall	health
when	he	graduated	as	physician	he	was	on	his	quest	to	be	specialized	in	overall	health
at	that	time	there	was	new	specialty	which	is	geriatric	medicine	that	goes	hand	in	hand	with	the	aging	society	that	thailand	is	now	facing
also	there	was	scholarship	to	study	in	the	united	states	of	america	offered
dr	tum	thus	chose	to	be	specialist	in	this	field	that	focuses	on	the	healthcare	of	the	elderly	of	years	old	or	above
after	he	graduated	he	became	resident	at	community	hospital	in	other	cities
at	those	hospitals	physicians	will	visit	patients	at	their	houses	to	know	their	lifestyle	and	get	better	understanding	of	the	patients
that	experience	sparks	the	idea	of	looking	after	patients	health	at	their	homes	in	dr	tums	mind
besides	when	he	was	in	america	dr	tum	got	to	visit	patients	at	their	houses	and	witnessed	the	high	technology	medical	equipment
physicians	and	nurses	can	examine	patients	just	like	how	they	do	in	the	hospital
all	patients	information	can	be	monitored	through	the	electronic	system	like	patients	are	hospitalized	at	home
nurses	will	visit	them	every	day	till	they	recovered
patients	do	not	have	to	go	to	the	hospital	or	stay	in	the	nursing	home	which	is	highly	favorable	for	them
after	dr	tum	has	returned	to	thailand	start	up	business	has	become	trendy
many	fundraising	happened
dr	tum	in	his	at	that	time	and	was	about	to	have	his	first	child	challenged	himself	by	joining	the	start	up	business	field
because	if	he	did	not	try	this	would	surely	stick	to	him
if	that	very	moment	had	passed	he	might	not	get	chance	to	do	it	anymore
and	if	he	was	older	he	would	not	want	to	tell	his	children	about	things	that	he	could	only	think	about	but	never	get	his	hands	on	them
however	if	he	succeeded	he	would	look	super	cool	in	his	childrens	eyes
even	if	he	did	not	succeed	he	would	still	have	fun	experience	to	tell	his	children
dr	tum	then	set	his	foot	in	the	path	of	start	up	business
he	became	start	up	doctor	whose	dream	is	to	see	thai	people	being	healthy	at	home
he	wanted	various	medical	services	to	be	easily	accessed	from	homes	without	people	having	to	go	to	the	hospital	even	though	this	dream	would	take	time
eventually	in	he	established	health	at	home	company	on	the	same	month	his	child	was	born
if	anyone	were	to	ask	how	long	his	company	has	established	dr	tum	can	instantly	tell	them	the	age	of	his	child
tips	to	start	business	and	conquer	challenges	the	dream	to	bring	medical	service	to	the	home	is	the	big	picture	in	dr	tums	mind
he	began	by	checking	the	market	demand	by	creating	website
he	listed	the	domain	under	the	name	health	at	home	in	th
on	the	website	there	is	short	message	for	people	who	are	interested	to	contact
after	that	he	bought	an	advertisement	on	google
the	price	is	around	baht	to	see	if	there	is	anyone	interested	clicked	and	contacted
when	there	is	demand	someone	will	have	to	take	care	of	it
dr	tums	friend	who	is	also	co	founder	knows	one	good	senior	that	used	to	take	care	of	their	cousin	that	was	just	passed	away
dr	tum	thus	invited	them	to	join	the	team
when	there	is	anyone	contacted	the	company	will	send	this	senior	to	do	the	job
at	that	time	there	was	no	proper	system	so	the	company	asked	customers	to	fill	up	their	medical	record	on	google	form	and	made	reports	by	photoshop	and	sent	to	the	customers
if	customers	had	questions	they	could	enquire
the	payment	was	done	via	normal	transactions
the	very	first	case	finished	with	everybody	feeling	happy
he	then	started	to	recruit	more	caretakers
when	there	are	more	caretakers	he	began	to	look	into	other	factors
for	example	building	up	team	or	setting	up	the	system
apart	from	that	dr	tum	joined	dtac	accelerator	which	was	project	supporting	thai	start	ups	at	that	time
this	gave	him	the	capital	to	develop	the	platform	and	website
it	was	moderate	start	from	what	he	could	do	at	that	moment
nowadays	the	platform	of	health	at	home	has	expanded	into	line	application
caretakers	and	service	recipients	can	select	work	and	service	according	to	their	demands
there	are	both	going	back	and	forth	and	staying	with	patients	at	home	and	hospitals
for	patients	who	have	limitation	in	staying	at	home	for	example	they	stay	in	the	condominium	with	limited	space	or	there	is	an	abuse	of	patient	within	the	family	there	is	care	center	that	is	designed	to	give	an	environment	similar	to	home	for	this	group	of	customers
caretaker	career	that	practices	science	and	arts	caretakers	play	an	important	role	in	thai	society
dr	tum	thus	wants	people	who	work	in	this	field	to	be	proud
when	they	take	pride	in	their	job	they	will	be	able	to	do	their	job	well
he	then	calls	the	caretakers	care	pro
in	order	to	be	caretakers	or	care	pro	under	health	at	home	candidates	will	undergo	an	interview	to	see	their	attitude
after	that	they	will	have	to	attend	the	training	to	sharpen	their	hard	skills	and	soft	skills	simultaneously
the	job	of	the	caretakers	includes	basic	physical	therapy	bedridden	patients	care	body	position	shifting	to	prevent	bedsores	bathing	and	rubbing	the	body	dry	as	well	as	room	cleaning
caretakers	will	work	in	team
they	can	change	shifts	or	work	for	one	another	in	the	same	standard
they	understand	patients	and	take	care	of	patients	like	their	own	family	members
if	caretakers	do	not	meet	the	standard	such	as	they	are	irresponsible	move	patients	wrongly	or	give	patients	the	wrong	medicine	harm	could	be	brought	upon	patients	caretakers	as	well	as	the	company
therefore	the	company	will	have	to	recruit	individuals	with	high	quality	and	positive	attitudes	towards	the	job
opportunity	from	the	outbreak	of	covid	during	the	outbreak	of	the	covid	pandemic	in	thailand	many	organizations	implemented	new	working	system	letting	their	employees	work	from	home	and	many	businesses	have	to	temporarily	close
the	demand	for	short	term	caretakers	thus	decreased
however	there	are	many	more	families	that	are	in	need	of	long	term	caretakers
the	problem	of	scarcity	of	caretakers	then	happened	because	many	caretakers	are	staying	in	different	cities	and	were	unable	to	travel	to	bangkok	and	attend	the	training
so	online	interviews	and	training	are	brought	forth	for	new	caretakers	to	study	about	their	job
for	caretakers	who	want	to	revise	their	skills	courses	are	created	for	them	to	further	improve	their	skills	with	both	courses	instructed	by	dr	tum	and	courses	instructed	by	the	nurse	team
for	patients	house	visits	this	is	chance	to	test	the	technology	of	both	virtual	visits	and	telemedicine
since	patients	families	have	an	idea	of	using	the	technology	physicians	and	nurses	can	advise	and	monitor	patients	condition	easily
as	for	caretakers	visit	video	call	is	being	used	instead
besides	online	collaboration	is	being	used	within	the	organization	and	it	allows	the	team	to	work	more	swiftly
getting	ready	for	an	aging	society	even	though	the	pandemic	situation	in	thailand	is	getting	better	an	aging	society	still	remains	for	thai	people	to	consider
dr	tum	then	left	advice	to	prepare	for	retirement	with	quality	money	time	and	power	as	followed	from	his	robust	experience	with	the	elderly	what	dr	tum	wanted	the	elderly	or	those	with	children	to	prepare	beforehand	is	to	make	future	plan	in	time	of	emergency
if	they	fall	sick	what	they	would	want	their	children	to	do
they	have	to	think	about	medical	treatment	and	financial	management	to	prevent	possible	family	problems	that	occurred	from	not	planning	for	unexpected	situations	or	unclear	talk
keys	to	success	for	start	up	business	becoming	start	up	business	is	like	running	marathon
there	are	not	many	runners	registered	but	everyone	wants	to	get	to	the	finishing	line
they	need	another	push	to	run	into	that	line	which	is	similar	to	start	up	business
being	geriatrician	is	like	spending	the	sunset	years	with	patients
dr	tum	discovered	that	elderly	gives	importance	to	valuable	relationship	because	the	meaning	of	life	eventually	is	about	being	together	with	people	they	love	and	seeing	that	they	are	happy
dr	tum	also	applied	the	maintaining	of	quality	relationships	into	his	family	life	and	work
he	tried	to	lead	life	to	meet	happy	ending	from	experiences	that	he	encountered
the	last	moments	of	life	are	not	complicated	and	not	required	much
so	do	not	forget	to	give	importance	to	people	who	mean	lot	to	us	while	they	are	still	alive

the	life	of	online	sellers	seems	not	easy
apart	from	daily	live	stream	selling	to	attract	and	ignite	customer	attention	online	sellers	have	to	take	orders	chat	with	customers	check	the	stocks	and	pack	products	right	away
its	quite	tough	at	times
scb	truly	understands	the	nature	of	online	sellers	so	launched	manee	social	commerce	new	features	developed	on	mae	manee	app	to	be	key	solutions	for	online	sellers	to	solve	all	their	pain	points	starting	from	the	sales	process	until	the	products	reach	customers	to	make	the	life	of	online	sellers	easier	and	also	boost	greater	sales
scb	reveals	the	daily	life	of	online	sellers	online	selling	is	now	in	the	era	of	tremendous	competition	and	helps	facilitate	customers	with	wide	variety	of	shopping	channels	for	instance	buying	from	market	place	like	lazada	shopee	or	from	shops	on	social	media	platforms	like	facebook	ig	etc
khun	orarat	chutimit	senior	executive	vice	president	chief	executive	officer	retail	and	business	banking	group	scb	mentioned	the	growth	of	businesses	on	online	platforms	at	present
she	reveals	that	the	commerce	market	value	amounted	to	over	hundred	billion	baht	in	an	increase	of	about	from	the	year	before
its	expected	that	the	market	will	grow	exponentially	higher	than	in	or	valued	at	hundred	billion	baht
she	also	predicts	that	the	competition	in	online	marketing	will	be	more	aggressive	and	those	who	adapt	themselves	first	will	have	an	advantage	over	the	other
scb	mae	manee	teamwork	conducts	an	in	depth	study	of	solo	online	seller	groups
khun	piyamas	siriwat	senior	executive	vice	president	managing	director	business	banking	non	lending	product	division	scb	shares	an	insight	gained	from	conversations	with	customers	that	online	sellers	spend	most	of	the	time	every	day	creating	content	chatting	with	customers	checking	stocks	and	packing	products
online	sellers	usually	sell	products	through	several	channels
the	paint	point	mostly	found	in	solo	online	sellers	is	they	handle	multi	tasks	alone	so	cant	manage	to	chat	with	customers	in	timely	manner	through	various	channels
when	the	reply	is	delayed	the	sellers	may	lose	their	customers
another	frequently	found	challenge	is	customers	want	to	make	credit	card	payments	or	make	installment	payments	for	high	ticket	items	but	they	cant	do	that	because	the	sellers	dont	have	an	edc	electronic	data	capture	so	they	lose	sales	opportunities
theres	also	inventory	management	which	most	sellers	handle	by	handwritten	or	creating	excel	files
the	problem	is	when	selling	products	through	multi	channels	they	forget	to	balance	stocks	and	that	causes	product	shortages
in	the	case	of	live	stream	selling	when	customers	send	cf	the	sellers	have	to	jot	down	orders	and	spend	time	at	late	night	to	arrange	those	orders
khun	orarat	suggests	that	when	sorting	out	all	problems	they	turn	out	to	be	day	to	day	management	for	online	selling	in	more	than	channel	unorganized	product	inventory	delayed	chat	with	customers	because	of	multi	sales	channels	and	customers	cant	make	installment	payments
we	realize	that	those	online	sellers	are	too	hectic	to	manage	time	to	study	or	develop	their	full	potential
all	those	challenges	will	be	solved	because	scb	understands	the	pain	points	of	the	online	seller	group

all	in	one	application
online	marketing	is	not	choice	but	survival
consumer	behavior	changes	and	purchasing	has	turned	much	more	to	online
even	high	ticket	items	like	car	or	house	purchasing	decision	has	also	shifted	more	to	online
therefore	online	marketing	is	essential	and	people	cant	wait	anymore
in	the	era	of	aggressive	competition	of	digital	marketing	we	found	that	this	competition	is	not	only	with	business	competitors	but	also	oneself	and	responding	to	customer	needs
anyway	online	marketing	is	somewhat	like	traditional	marketing
the	obvious	differences	are	physical	characteristics	process	and	target	group
we	introduce	processes	of	running	online	marketing	as	guidelines	to	novices	for	easier	success
market	research	this	means	to	understand	the	market	customers	competitors	and	to	identify	who	they	are	as	that	is	the	most	important	process	to	run	the	market
we	must	look	for	winning	zone	the	point	well	win	the	point	we	differentiate	our	brand	from	competitors	and	the	point	that	customers	need
many	brands	miss	the	latter	as	they	present	selling	point	that	is	not	customer	needs
that	selling	point	is	our	strength	but	customers	dont	want	it
even	we	as	well	as	the	competitors	have	that	strong	point	and	we	compete	with	each	other	but	customers	dont	need	it	anyway
another	failure	in	most	brands	is	to	copy	brand	claims	from	competitors
in	fact	some	products	may	not	need	the	same	selling	points
each	customer	has	unique	desire
when	the	target	customer	changes	everything	follows
do	not	put	effort	to	claim	things	that	we	dont	have
the	winning	zone	of	each	customer	and	group	vary	and	we	have	to	study	what	it	is
deep	customer	understanding	we	should	segment	targets	so	we	can	reach	target	customers
that	is	to	define	how	many	customer	groups	are	in	one	single	product	by	classifying	age	location	lifestyle	and	the	possibility	of	purchasing
sometimes	some	products	may	have	over	ten	customer	groups
due	to	limited	manpower	time	and	budget	we	can	divide	customers	into	groups	are	customers	whom	we	need	the	most	and	we	can	close	sale	effectively
at	this	step	we	will	consider	picking	one	out	of	over	ten	customer	groups	by	referring	to	the	selected	winning	zone	and	judge	which	group	we	can	mostly	approach
in	this	way	we	can	identify	customer	problems	what	they	want	and	dont	want
many	people	may	overlook	what	customers	dont	want	but	this	issue	is	really	interesting
for	example	when	presenting	some	products	that	customers	need	with	features	that	help	fix	the	problem	and	then	adding	unwanted	features
customers	may	think	your	presentations	are	overwhelming	and	overdemanding	they	probably	feel	that	your	product	features	have	more	than	what	they	need	and	the	price	is	too	high
we	dont	have	to	tell	customers	everything	wed	rather	be	specific	present	good	and	bad	points	with	all	necessary	conditions	to	them
selection	of	promotional	channels	selecting	which	channel	we	should	promote	products	by	looking	at	customer	journey
that	means	to	chase	where	we	can	penetrate	customers	whether	it	is	facebook	line	official	account	instagram	twitter	or	else	by	selecting	major	channel	that	customers	are	on
content	creation	when	knowing	customer	needs	and	the	right	channel	its	time	to	create	content	in	line	with	your	channel	penetrate	target	customers	identify	customer	concerns	and	finally	create	online	content
your	content	should	be	easy	to	find	and	search	and	can	be	good	reference	when	making	purchase	decision	advertising	considering	how	we	will	advertise	our	products	including	measurement	tools
also	thinking	about	the	objectives	for	advertising	defining	the	target	available	budget	and	advertising	period
measurement	after	creating	an	ad	campaign	the	next	steps	are	the	measurement	process	which	covers	tools	topics	and	spent	budget	whether	its	worth	spending
concerning	issues	of	the	advertising	is	measurement	of	prompt	sales	volume	like	view	and	share
each	objective	uses	different	measurement	mechanism
key	learning	after	completing	the	campaign	results	will	be	summarized	in	either	one	week	or	one	month	if	the	plan	is	set	beforehand
key	learning	from	every	step	we	ran	through	can	be	extended	to	another	action
as	marketing	is	test	so	it	doesnt	mean	that	what	you	do	today	will	guarantee	an	outcome	tomorrow
if	theres	no	sales	volume	today	what	will	you	do	tomorrow
so	there	must	be	real	test	and	fight	in	the	field
take	your	key	learning	to	improve	for	the	better	and	keep	testing
all	guidelines	are	fundamental	processes	for	online	marketing	that	beginners	can	follow	as	keys	to	start	business
be	reminded	that	marketing	is	test	and	therere	no	fixed	rules	for	everyone
just	start	doing	and	gradually	adjusting	your	plan	until	you	find	the	right	formula	for	each	target	group

in	the	past	many	countries	around	the	world	have	implemented	lockdown	measures	close	the	country	to	reduce	social	distance
this	method	has	been	effective
the	number	of	infected	people	has	decreased
but	the	economy	stumbled	to	halt
when	returning	to	normal	situation	the	number	of	infected	people	also	skyrocketed
the	concept	of	living	with	covid	is	another	option	that	many	countries	would	like	to	try	out
in	case	this	method	may	be	the	best	solution
some	countries	have	declared	covid	has	become	local	disease	so	that	people	can	live	with	the	covid	smoothly
today	invite	you	to	look	at	the	situation	of	fighting	covid	of	each	country	in	the	clmv	group
how	did	they	adjust	according	to	the	next	normal	way	during	last	years
let	start	with	cambodia	first
in	the	past	cambodia	is	considered	one	of	the	fastest	in	the	asean	region	that	has	distributed	and	mobilized	the	vaccination	against	covid	by	receiving	vaccine	support	from	many	countries	and	organizations	such	as	sinovac	vaccines	and	sino	farms	from	china	astrazeneca	vaccine	under	the	world	health	organization	covax	program
and	the	pfizer	vaccine	donated	by	the	australian	government
cambodia	has	mobilized	full	dose	vaccination	for	of	the	total	population	of	million	people	as	of	march
cambodia	has	eased	immigration	measures	and	announced	the	full	opening	of	the	country	in	all	areas	by	adhering	to	the	way	of	living	with	covid	in	new	way
cambodia	has	managed	an	effective	vaccine	administration	along	with	public	health	measures	that	are	conducive	to	investor	entry	into	the	country	business	people	and	tourists
this	is	positive	factor	that	makes	the	overall	economy	in	the	country	tend	to	recover	continuously
the	world	bank	group	has	forecast	cambodia	economy	to	grow	at	for	before	the	covid	outbreak
at	around	which	is	very	satisfactory	number
and	it	can	build	confidence	for	investors	and	entrepreneurs	who	are	interested	in	doing	business	in	cambodia	as	well
the	next	country	is	laos	pdr
for	the	year	there	has	been	big	highlight	of	the	country	namely	on	december	which	corresponds	to	the	national	day	of	laos	pdr	has	announced	the	use	of	the	china	laos	electric	train
this	is	one	of	the	belt	and	road	initiative	bri	projects	that	china	has	planned	to	connect	the	economy	between	china	and	asean	whose	destination	is	singapore	this	project	is	project	of	the	country	hopes	that	it	can	greatly	stimulate	the	country	economy
last	january	the	lao	pdr	government	has	launched	drug	molacovir	which	can	be	produced	within	the	country	itself
it	is	cooperation	between	germany	and	lao	pdr	which	is	the	same	drug	as	molnupiravir	used	to	treat	influenza
it	can	be	used	to	treat	covid	patients	at	the	initial	stage
the	patient	must	be	over	years	of	age	without	pneumonia	and	does	not	fall	into	state	of	hypoxia
patient	must	take	pills	at	time	times	day	continuously	for	days	which	costs	jar	of	kip	approximately	baht	average	baht	tablet
it	is	considered	good	signal	for	lao	pdr	to	develop	the	economy	according	to	the	new	next	normal	way	for	the	economy	to	move	forward	build	confidence	for	investors	who	have	goal	of	moving	towards	lao	pdr
for	the	republic	of	the	union	of	myanmar	it	is	well	known	that	in	the	past	myanmar	has	faced	both	domestic	political	problems	and	the	epidemic	of	covid
currently	the	situation	has	almost	returned	to	normal
theres	remains	on	the	spread	of	covid	that	is	still	spreading	consistent	with	the	world
as	for	trade	and	investment	with	thailand	in	myanmar	imported	goods	from	thailand	increased	by	from	the	previous	year
the	ministry	of	commerce	predicts	that	in	myanmar	will	import	more	products	from	thailand	another	reflects	preference	for	thai	products
and	thailand	is	neighboring	country	with	adjacent	borders	which	is	convenient	for	transportation	of	goods
although	at	present	the	international	commercial	aviation	of	the	republic	of	the	union	of	myanmar	is	not	in	service
if	necessary	travel	authorization	is	required	including	complying	with	measures	to	prevent	the	spread	of	covid
but	for	land	transportation	through	the	border	can	still	operate	normally	except	for	personal	travel	through	the	border	that	still	need	the	same	permission
in	the	socialist	republic	of	vietnam	nearly	of	the	population	has	received	two	doses	of	the	vaccine	but	as	of	february	the	covid	pandemic	was	hit	severely	from	the	omicron	strain	during	the	first	days	of	march
the	number	of	infected	people	increased	by	an	average	of	people	day
in	order	to	stimulate	the	economy	especially	the	tourism	sector	to	bring	back	income	after	two	years	of	lockdown	from	march	vietnam	will	open	the	country	to	welcome	tourists
those	coming	to	vietnam	must	be	fully	vaccinated	have	test	results	for	covid	negative	both	before	departure	and	after	arrival
they	also	must	have	health	insurance	coverage	of	us	or	more
in	addition	in	vietnam	as	the	host	of	the	st	sea	games	is	still	running	the	competition
it	was	postponed	from	the	previous	year	due	to	the	severe	epidemic	situation	of	the	delta	species

change	is	an	important	variable	to	run	the	business	in	the	new	normal	and	marketers	must	explore	this	change	and	adjust	suitable	marketing	plan
short	term	marketing	plan	marketers	need	to	know	consumer	groups	and	adjust	products	and	service	functions	to	cater	to	their	needs
consumer	groups	comprise	categories	according	to	harvard	business	review
slam	on	the	brakes	consumers	this	is	the	most	vulnerable	group	as	they	were	directly	affected
they	have	reduced	all	kinds	of	spending	like	unnecessary	goods	deferred	purchases	purchase	fewer	essentials	and	purchase	cheaper	goods
this	consumer	group	earns	low	income	or	may	have	high	income	but	feel	panic	because	of	crisis
marketers	should	emphasize	product	quality	essential	products	for	consumers	and	affordable	prices
promotions	of	new	products	with	free	gifts	or	free	delivery	will	also	create	good	value	for	money	for	customers	for	products	that	customers	tend	to	buy	less	or	deferred	buying	marketers	still	need	an	ongoing	advertisement	so	customers	can	recall	your	products	and	may	buy	them	later
pained	but	patient	consumers	these	customers	are	uncertain	about	the	current	situation	but	believe	that	things	will	be	better	in	the	long	run
most	consumers	fall	into	this	category	comprising	those	with	varying	levels	of	income	and	still	reduce	all	kinds	of	spending	but	not	as	strict	as	the	first	group
this	group	still	has	to	buy	power	and	tends	to	stock	essential	products	for	long	term	use
marketers	should	offer	products	at	special	prices	when	buying	more	or	reward	customers	with	extra	points	or	offer	free	membership	renewal	fee
and	to	reduce	customer	anxiety	marketers	should	build	trust	in	the	service	availability	and	production	capacity	to	meet	future	demand
comfortably	well	off	consumers	these	customers	earn	high	income	or	may	earn	moderate	income	but	feel	secure	within	their	financial	status
they	still	spend	their	money	as	usual	but	are	more	considerate	to	buy	things	and	tend	to	buy	less	high	ticket	items
to	boost	buying	productivity	of	this	group	suitable	marketing	campaign	is	to	make	customers	feel	like	rewarding	themselves	when	buying	products
special	promotion	that	has	never	existed	may	be	arranged	to	accelerate	customer	decision	to	buy	and	to	feel	they	dont	want	to	miss	it
advertising	of	consumer	products	should	be	continually	active	with	an	emphasis	that	customers	cant	live	without	your	products
live	for	today	consumers	these	customers	spend	their	money	normally	and	dont	care	much	about	saving	money
most	of	them	stay	in	the	big	cities	and	are	quite	young
they	love	spending	on	things	that	bring	new	experiences
their	consuming	behaviors	can	only	be	changed	once	they	lose	their	jobs	and	earn	no	income
to	market	with	these	customers	we	use	method	called	carpe	diem	which	means	seize	the	day	or	one	should	enjoy	life	while	one	can
therefore	products	or	services	should	offer	worthwhile	experience	and	high	quality	of	life
as	these	customers	are	tech	savvy	marketers	should	focus	on	advanced	technology	and	customer	data	security	to	build	trust	with	them
medium	term	marketing	plan	the	core	of	this	plan	is	to	create	an	impressive	experience	for	customers	with	the	right	strategy
special	solutions	and	extra	service	referring	to	the	survey	by	merkle	website	providing	marketing	data	the	factor	that	mostly	affects	customers	is	service	cancellation	letter	from	ceo	and	an	announcement	about	employee	supporting	plan
therefore	one	of	the	effective	marketing	strategies	is	to	stay	close	to	your	customers	by	clearly	informing	them	that	the	services	remain	unchanged	and	offer	additional	service	as	choice	for	them
digital	resources	online	shopping	is	both	current	and	growing	trend	in	the	future
apart	from	shifting	platforms	from	store	trading	to	online	one	thing	the	marketers	shouldnt	ignore	is	to	provide	easy	applicable	instructions	especially	for	novice	consumers
its	important	to	give	clear	product	information	such	as	the	balance	on	hand	quantity	discount	and	delivery	schedule
call	center	or	hotline	team	also	has	to	be	ready	to	answer	customer	questions	as	fast	as	possible	because	customers	will	score	this	service	as	much	as	out	of	points
relevant	communication	providing	information	for	consumers	is	another	factor	to	create	their	good	experiences
if	we	visit	the	getaway	website	cabin	rental	company	it	clearly	states	that	cabin	cleaning	is	arranged	twice	as	much	as	usual	each	cabin	keeps	distancing	all	staff	wear	masks	and	keep	at	least	foot	physical	distancing	from	customers
this	information	is	also	mailed	to	customers	in	the	same	direction
customers	will	feel	at	ease	as	theyre	allowed	to	change	or	cancel	their	check	in	dates
getaway	is	model	business	that	prioritizes	content	and	effective	communication	with	customers
most	importantly	the	company	has	built	standpoint	as	solution	for	customers	during	this	uncertain	era
long	term	marketing	plan	research	done	by	forresters	siriusdecisions	suggested	that	we	prepare	communication	tools	to	generate	high	profit	in	the	long	term
webinars	and	virtual	events	online	events	and	chat	should	be	held	with	customers	to	replace	traditional	meetings
this	is	an	effective	way	to	connect	to	customers	while	providing	product	and	service	information	including	company	updates	and	to	strongly	retain	the	customer	base
content	marketing	produce	to	share	news	good	stories	or	innovation	with	customers
the	company	should	continually	follow	up	and	evaluate	each	content	for	better	improvement
social	media	select	variety	of	media	and	focus	on	chat	or	live	events	to	penetrate	customer	groups
one	on	one	conversation	can	be	added	to	substitute	face	to	face	meetings
website	chatbots	this	is	program	responding	to	customers	via	text	or	text	to	speech	and	helping	customers	who	are	searching	products	on	the	website	by	answering	questions	and	finding	products	they	need
this	platform	also	enables	online	salespersons	to	contact	customers	for	further	assistance
video	this	is	communication	tool	that	presents	detailed	understandable	and	clear	information	which	can	be	delivered	through	diverse	channels
marketers	are	able	to	produce	complex	and	complicate	information	through	video	to	make	content	more	comprehensible	to	customers
lead	nurturing	building	relationship	with	customers	is	the	most	important	strategy
forrester	research	found	that	company	that	has	positive	relations	with	customers	can	generate	more	sales	with	less	than	of	the	budget
even	though	sales	volume	over	the	crisis	was	not	quite	high	but	customers	will	certainly	return	their	purchase	to	your	products
customer	stories	and	testimonials	the	product	review	by	customers	reaffirms	the	product	quality	or	service	and	it	will	create	social	proof	phenomenon	that	will	bring	trust	from	other	customers	and	their	decision	to	buy	your	product	or	service
although	an	unstable	economy	still	exists	but	business	sector	should	make	the	most	of	this	time	by	studying	consumer	behaviors	creating	relationships	with	them	and	consistently	expressing	empathy	to	them
an	adjustment	to	all	marketing	plans	is	new	strategies	to	build	trust	and	wonderful	experiences	to	customers	while	the	entrepreneurs	are	expecting	to	have	loyal	customers	as	long	as	possible
professional	and	comprehensive	business	management	solution
new	digital	banking	platform	to	enhance	the	financial	experience	for	business	customers
online	shopping	has	become	consumer	behavior	today
therefore	online	marketing	is	not	an	option	but	business	salvation
however	there	are	still	some	entrepreneurs	who	think	that	it	is	not	necessary	because	of	the	frequent	customers	buying
but	if	the	regular	customers	are	gone	where	can	entrepreneurs	find	new	customers
because	of	the	behavior	of	the	new	generation	of	consumers	are	accustomed	to	or	stuck	with	online	shopping
because	it	means	survival	in	the	digital	age	khun	benya	jongmeesuk	associate	planner	director	dotmatters	will	share	with	you	digital	trend	in	this	includes	buying	online	advertisements	that	will	increase	the	efficiency	of	reaching	potential	customers	as	guide	for	beginners	to	sell	online	so	that	they	can	understand	the	principles	and	grow	their	business	further
digital	trend	nowadays	there	is	no	denying	that	social	media	is	the	powerful	medium	of	the	digital	age
can	reach	more	target	customers	in	wider	and	niche	segment	than	traditional	media
hun	benya	from	dotmatters	said	that	over	the	years	online	media	has	become	huge	influence	on	doing	business
able	to	grow	increase	sales	generate	profit	for	the	business	sustainably
with	the	strength	of	being	able	to	determine	the	reach	of	leads	more	effectively	than	traditional	media
while	the	thai	population	is	currently	only	per	year	the	thai	population	on	social	media	is	increasing	by	million	year
this	means	that	thais	are	living	online	more	and	more	every	year	and	most	importantly	the	population	of	children	and	the	elderly	are	increasing	the	use	of	social	media	as	well
gender	all	ages	advertising	in	the	online	world	is	necessary	and	inevitable
according	to	hootsuite	the	top	five	platforms	in	thailand	are	facebook	youtube	which	means	that	both	facebook	and	youtube	are	very	important	social	media
meanwhile	line	followed	in	third	place	which	is	the	platform	that	everyone	uses	to	chat	to	communicate	with	each	other	fb	messenger	and	instagram	all	five	are	considered	important	social	platforms	that	businesses	must	use
in	doing	online	advertising	khun	benya	further	said	that	when	it	comes	to	selling	things	online	through	commerce	most	people	think	of	selling	clothes
selling	things	through	commerce	can	be	very	diverse
according	to	statistics	of	thai	people	it	is	found	that	products	with	the	most	value	in	commerce	are	fashion	and	beauty	products	electronic	products	and	media	tourism	food	and	personal	care	products	and	furniture	and	appliance	products
and	during	the	covid	period	of	foreign	tourism	stagnation	but	domestic	travel	packages	have	grown	more
so	you	can	see	that	in	crisis	there	are	still	opportunities	for	online	sales
and	according	to	statistics	of	thai	people	shopping	online	in	it	is	found	that	the	average	price	is	baht	per	year	while	in	an	average	of	baht	or	baht	per	year	which	shows	that	thai	people	shop	online
more	for	more	expensive	price	entrepreneurs	are	required	to	do	online	advertising	to	reach	their	target	customers
in	addition	the	fact	that	thai	people	shop	online	has	increased	significantly
entrepreneurs	must	not	forget	that	in	the	online	battlefield	there	are	many	competitors	selling	the	same	things	as	ours	both	inside	and	outside	the	country
when	there	are	many	competitors	it	is	not	easy	to	do	marketing	to	find	the	right	customers
therefore	it	must	be	method	of	buying	online	advertisements
because	the	more	customers	see	our	products	the	greater	the	chance	to	sell	them
because	of	the	organic	release	customers	may	only	see	people	but	buying	an	ad	will	be	able	to	identify	the	target	audience	they	want
it	gives	an	opportunity	to	stimulate	the	interest	of	the	customer	and	ultimately	make	an	order	with	us
in	addition	buying	online	ads	can	also	measure	results	and	see	how	much	more	money	spent	on	advertisements	will	get	back	in	sales
why	use	digital	media
as	mentioned	above	all	roads	lead	to	online	so	entrepreneurs	whether	big	or	small	must	walk	the	social	media	route	because	that	means	huge	number	of	customers	waiting	for	them
in	addition	the	advantages	of	social	media	are	easy	to	do	by	yourself
adjust	at	any	time	measurable	save	more	advertising	budget	than	offline
because	you	can	control	the	cost	of	how	much	advertising	you	should	buy	from	the	sales	or	profits	that	you	have	and	be	able	to	reach	your	target	audience	for	example	sell	sanitary	napkins	if	an	ad	on	television	men	may	not	need	to	see	this	ad	but	have	to	pay	for	male	customers	who	are	not	targeted	to	see	but	when	it	comes	to	buying	an	online	ad	we	can	set	it	up	to	be	seen	only	by	women	which	will	save	more	budgets	than	both	women	and	men
or	even	setting	the	age	range	to	be	more	focused	on	more	specific	audience	and	more	cost	effective	than	traditional	media
joining	platforms	to	drive	online	sales	although	there	are	many	online	platforms	that	thai	people	use	there	are	only	platforms	that	entrepreneurs	and	businesspeople	need	to	be	weapon	to	reach	their	target	customers
khun	benya	recommends	using	the	following	platforms	line	for	business	google	ads	facebook	ads	line	for	business	or	line	official	account	line	for	business	or	line	official	account	is	line	official	account
for	businesses	that	allow	their	merchants	to	build	their	own	shop	follower	base
able	to	communicate	with	customers	and	send	information	about	sales	and	marketing	activities	or	promotions	to	customers	via	line
line	which	is	better	than	the	conventional	line	because	it	can	communicate	with	many	customers	at	once
plus	there	are	features	that	help	the	store	to	manage	sales	more	efficiently	such	as	creating	greeting	message
auto	reply	messages	chats	broadcasting	to	all	subscribers	or	targeted	broadcasting	etc
therefore	it	is	desirable	for	sme	to	try	it	out	and	it	is	must	if	if	you	are	doing	business	online	google	ads	google	ads	from	changing	consumer	behavior	nowadays	when	shopping	most	people	are	searching	for	information
therefore	when	customers	search	and	see	the	name	of	the	shop	or	product	on	the	first	page	the	opportunity	to	sell	the	product	is	greater	where	the	purchase	of	google	ads	can	buy	keywords	for	customers	to	search	for	products
khun	benya	suggested	that	entrepreneurs	need	to	have	their	own	website	for	their	customers	to	find	it
this	is	an	online	presence	that	creates	brand	credibility
customers	have	confidence	in	products	and	services

professional	and	comprehensive	business	management	solution
the	most	common	situations	that	all	sellers	would	encounter	would	be	when	customers	pass	them	that	big	note	and	they	have	no	change	for	it
they	have	to	hurry	to	their	next	door	neighbors	to	exchange	for	small	notes
even	nowadays	that	transaction	can	be	done	through	the	application	both	sellers	and	buyers	will	have	to	wait	till	the	transaction	is	completed	and	confirmed
this	is	huge	bother	to	grab	and	go	customers	because	the	sellers	at	the	shop	will	have	to	wait	for	confirmation	from	the	owner	who	is	not	present	at	the	shop	at	that	time
if	this	happens	during	the	golden	hours	like	lunch	break	in	shopping	area	at	central	business	district	that	seller	has	to	take	care	of	many	customers	at	time	it	would	be	horrifying	to	imagine	all	the	hassles	and	financial	mistakes	that	could	happen
to	have	employees	helping	to	take	care	of	the	retail	shop	thus	cannot	completely	lift	the	burden	off	the	owner
this	is	because	the	owner	will	have	to	actively	check	their	mobile	phone	for	the	transferred	amount	and	confirm	it	to	their	employees	immediately	so	that	their	lovely	customers	will	not	have	to	wait	for	too	long
from	now	on	those	worries	will	be	cast	away	because	there	is	mae	manee	helper	of	all	sellers	in	transactions
it	is	developed	to	another	level	by	adding	function	that	the	owner	can	add	the	phone	number	of	their	employees
whenever	there	is	transaction	made	apart	from	the	bank	account	owner	the	notification	will	be	sent	to	the	numbers	added	as	well
there	is	not	need	to	waste	such	precious	time	waiting	for	the	confirmation	anymore
it	brings	convenience	to	the	owner	employee	and	customer
all	of	them	can	now	pay	and	receive	safely	and	swiftly
especially	the	owner	who	will	get	to	have	more	free	time	and	use	this	time	to	add	values	to	their	business	such	as	exploring	new	markets	to	increase	products	in	the	shop	contacting	the	suppliers	to	produce	more	products	or	relaxing	by	going	for	movie	without	having	to	worry	about	all	these
besides	it	decreases	the	workload	of	managing	incomes	and	expenses	because	the	application	will	clearly	separate	the	income	of	the	shop	and	personal	transactions	from	each	other
it	also	reduces	the	risk	of	classic	crime	like	counterfeit	money	and	most	importantly	it	is	free	of	charge
there	is	no	need	to	pay	extra	fees	for	using	the	service
having	an	application	that	serves	as	an	electronic	wallet	can	unexpectedly	create	an	opportunity	to	increase	sales
buyers	are	not	bound	by	the	cash	they	carry	in	their	wallets	because	most	of	the	time	they	do	not	plan	to	shop	but	they	happen	to	like	the	goods
with	an	wallet	and	qr	code	that	accepts	both	cash	and	credit	card	payments	from	any	bank	they	can	immediately	make	decision	in	purchasing	the	product	regardless	of	its	price
therefore	if	you	or	your	employees	are	silver	tongued	mae	manee	might	be	able	to	gain	money	beyond	your	expectation
the	method	to	register	for	mae	manee	application	is	really	simple
the	shop	owner	just	has	to	be	layperson	with	saving	account	or	current	account	single	account	of	scb	and	registered	scb	easy	application
with	these	conditions	fulfilled	the	owner	can	immediately	create	an	wallet	for	their	shop
to	add	employees	phone	numbers	is	just	piece	of	cake
employees	just	have	to	download	mae	manee	application	choose	the	status	as	an	employee	and	fill	in	their	mobile	number	and	digit	password	received	from	the	owner	and	accept	service	terms	and	conditions
they	have	to	reconfirm	their	identity	once	more	with	otp	received	from	the	system
these	easy	steps	and	the	real	time	transaction	will	reflect	on	your	phone	like	mirror	in	way	that	the	owner	does	not	have	to	keep	watch	at	their	shop	and	screen	anymore

thailand	is	in	the	process	of	transitioning	into	an	aging	society
it	is	expected	that	by	thai	society	will	enter	the	aged	society	and	will	enter	the	super	aged	society	in	this	situation	is	result	of	thai	people	tend	to	live	longer
have	both	fewer	and	slower	children	causing	the	number	and	proportion	of	the	thai	elderly	population	to	increase	rapidly
by	entering	the	aging	society	there	must	be	population	of	elderly	people	per	people	and	if	there	are	elderly	people	up	to	percent	of	the	total	population	will	result	in	that	country	entering	the	next	highest	level	of	an	aging	society
nevertheless	the	predictions	can	vary	with	the	birth	rate	of	the	new	population	and	the	mortality	rate	of	the	general	population
from	the	said	situation	the	elderly	care	business	is	therefore	business	that	will	respond	to	the	growing	needs	of	the	elderly	in	thailand
elderly	care	business	means	non	hospital	services	with	service	to	reside	drug	services	for	the	elderly	that	do	not	need	to	be	under	the	supervision	of	doctor	regularly
generally	covers	overnight	accommodation	food	housekeeping	and	accommodation
as	well	as	cleanliness	of	the	body	along	with	closely	following	basic	health	care	but	didn	provide	medical	treatment
if	there	is	an	illness	the	referral	will	be	delivered	to	the	patient	department	of	nearby	hospital	for	further	treatment
department	of	business	development	categorized	the	elderly	care	business	by	private	services	according	to	the	service	into	large	dimensions	as	follows	dimension	divided	according	to	the	length	of	time	that	the	elderly	is	admitted	that	have	types	which	are	dimension	divided	according	to	the	care	needs	of	the	elderly	who	receive	the	service	divided	into	types	which	are	at	present	the	elderly	care	business	has	combination	of	care	and	services	in	both	groups
according	to	survey	conducted	by	the	siam	commercial	bank	for	economic	and	business	research	scb	eic	more	than	of	seniors	want	to	live	in	their	home	after	retirement
but	with	the	size	of	smaller	family	of	only	people	when	the	children	must	go	to	work	so	do	not	have	time	to	look	after	the	elderly	at	home	alone
especially	the	elderly	at	home	and	bed	which	is	the	group	that	needs	the	most	care
however	home	care	is	times	lower	than	the	average	hospital	stay	making	home	care	or	home	care	services	good	choice	for	most	elderly	people
home	care	business	is	available	to	meet	the	needs	of	the	elderly	in	thai	society	that	prefer	to	stay	at	home
with	the	tendency	to	develop	more	comprehensive	service	models
not	just	providing	health	care	for	the	elderly	but	the	home	care	business	is	also	full	service	business	in	terms	of	homemaking
such	as	cleaning	do	housework	food	preparation	for	the	elderly	including	taking	care	of	the	minds	of	the	elderly	as	well
the	home	care	business	in	thailand	is	therefore	one	of	the	businesses	that	have	more	opportunities	to	grow	in	the	future
it	is	also	business	that	does	not	require	high	investment	easy	to	manage	which	the	important	thing	that	these	business	needs	are	quality	caregivers	and	nurses	with	skills	data	from	the	department	of	business	development	nov	shows	that	there	are	around	elderly	care	business	operators	divided	into	legal	entities	with	total	registered	capital	of	million	baht
and	are	around	individuals
there	are	businesses	that	have	passed	the	quality	management	criteria	legal	entities	and	individuals
but	if	comparing	the	number	of	businesses	with	the	proportion	of	the	elderly	population	increasing	every	year	will	see	that	there	are	still	gaps	in	the	market	demand	and	there	are	many	opportunities	for	those	interested	in	entering	this	business	however	the	main	problem	of	the	elderly	care	business	in	thailand	is	to	summarize	businesses	that	are	related	to	the	elderly	are	interesting	and	have	lot	of	opportunities	to	grow	in	the	long	run
those	interested	in	starting	to	invest	in	business	should	study	the	standards	of	the	business	to	take	good	care	of	the	elderly

how	can	marketers	be	able	to	speed	up	to	meet	the	needs	of	consumers	in	timely	manner
and	optimize	the	backyard	process	to	have	the	potential	to	create	sales	goals	successfully
khun	jittipong	lertpradit	author	of	the	book	marketing	technology	trend	and	head	of	digital	marketing	plus	property	co	ltd	shared	his	experience	of	using	marketing	technology	with	the	participants	of	the	scb	iep	project	model	digital	commerce
to	help	entrepreneurs	learn	professional	marketing	with	technology	changing	the	business	world	with	technology	khun	jittipong	said	that	in	the	past	years	ago	when	producing	video	one	had	to	hire	graphic	designer	for	baht	hire	an	editor	for	baht	had	to	buy	adobe	photoshop	and	pay	royalty	fee	of	baht	per	month	including	expenses
per	month	about	baht
later	there	is	adobe	creative	cloud	paid	subscription	for	baht	per	year	but	you	must	hire	graphic	designer	anyway
in	the	present	era	there	is	technology	called	no	coding	platform
it	is	web	that	does	not	require	coding
you	can	drag	and	drop	and	make	graphics	immediately
for	example	if	you	want	to	make	mobile	app	you	can	complete	it	within	days
or	in	the	past	hr	if	the	system	is	missing	late	arrival	have	to	hire	someone	to	do	the	program	it	takes	months	costs	about	baht	but	currently	has	no	coding	platform	it	takes	only	week	to	complete
plus	the	service	fee	is	only	baht	per	head
if	the	company	has	employees	the	cost	is	only	baht	per	month
the	use	of	software	can	help	reduce	costs	reduce	time	do	business	in	timely	manner
or	in	the	past	when	making	website	if	you	want	to	modify	the	font	or	add	social	media	buttons	design	must	have	to	wait	for	the	it	side
but	nowadays	the	entire	website	can	be	edited	in	just	minutes
the	use	of	technology	in	doing	business
this	makes	it	more	convenient	and	faster	than	before	reducing	costs	and	able	to	open	the	game	to	penetrate	the	business	in	timely	manner
therefore	would	like	operators	to	try	to	study	new	technologies
to	develop	their	own	business
know	the	basics	of	data	collection
there	are	two	types	of	data	collection	explicit	data	customers	fill	out	the	information	directly	to	us
both	offline	and	online	get	to	know	martech	for	businesses	crm	technology	system	that	helps	manage	customer	relationships	from	upstream	to	downstream
sales	management	sale	pipeline	the	system	will	help	plan	the	steps	of	the	sales	process	for	the	relevant	departments	to	perform	such	as	marketing	sales	after	sales	service
able	to	manage	easier	to	know	which	stage	our	customers	are	in	and	what	action	should	be	taken	to	customers
manage	crm	royalty	such	as	after	purchasing	the	product	how	to	return	to	buy	again	buy	more	collect	points	or	give	special	privileges	to	customers	etc
illustration	from	the	illustration	there	are	agencies	involved	namely	marketing	sales	and	customer	success
marketing	uses	marketing	tools	such	as	content	marketing	seo	sem	social	media	etc
to	attract	customers	to	visit	the	website	drop	lead	then	the	sales	team	will	pick	up	by	meeting	with	customers
offer	to	customers	to	try	the	product	until	ordering	and	the	customer	success	team
will	be	trained	to	use	after	sales	management	as	well	as	encouraging	to	buy	more	products	and	expand	the	service	to	other	related	services
the	crm	system	has	dashboard	to	view	reports	such	as	sales	overview	how	much	percent	purchase	rate	the	number	of	days	to	close	the	sale
including	seeing	how	much	value	each	deal	can	generate	etc	marketing	automation	is	to	use	tools	or	systems	to	help	deliver	tasks	in	both	marketing	and	sales	to	be	driven	automatically	to	reduce	the	time	reduce	the	use	of	human	labor	helping	to	save	more	budget	in	various	aspects	illustration	from	the	illustration	when	lead	enters	the	system	within	days	the	system	will	automatically	send	an	email	to	invite	potential	customers	to	come	to	the	webinar
if	the	customer	registers	the	system	will	ask	for	more	information	to	register	for	the	webinar
the	system	will	send	an	email	to	read	business	research	etc
marketing	automation	helps	marketers	understand	the	needs	of	their	customers
offer	what	is	right	for	your	customers
able	to	collect	data	and	analyze	customer	behavior	to	increase	the	likelihood	of	closing	sale
and	help	reduce	working	time	from	the	original	manual	labor	customer	data	platform	cdp	marketing	tools	help	centralize	data	from	multiple	sources
both	offline	and	online	together
this	allows	marketers	to	know	more	insights	of	their	customers
by	taking	the	information	that	has	been	analyzed	and	marketing	it	back	to	each	customer
for	example	this	customer	who	buys	stuff	at	the	end	of	every	month	is	expected	to	be	salaryman	so	before	or	after	the	end	of	the	month	days	will	send	coupon	to	stimulate	spending	if	buying	more	than	baht	give	discount
or	in	singapore	the	pizzeria	will	retrieve	the	weather	forecast
if	it	rains	today	it	will	shoot	ad	to	customers	in	the	subway	that	it	raining	today
can	order	pizza	in	advance	before	get	home	and	eat	pizza	right	away	etc
visitor	identification	technology	tool	to	verify	the	identity	of	website	visitors	from	their	ip	address	where	they	come	from
for	example	the	system	says	that	in	the	last	days	company	visits	the	website
when	it	sees	the	data	it	is	enough	to	know	that	the	company	might	be	interested	in	our	products
the	method	is	to	go	to	linkedin	and	find	list	of	marketing	managers	to	contact	us	to	offer	our	products
the	longitude	of	the	web	visitor	from	which	city	country	which	these	data	can	be	applied	to	for	example	localize	web	content	if	the	company	focuses	on	chinese	customers	when	the	system	informs	that	the	ip	address	is	from	china	customers	can	be	sent	to	the	chinese	website	immediately
price	optimization	if	the	condo	is	sold	when	the	system	says	that	if	the	customer	is	from	hong	kong	the	selling	price	will	be	indicated	at	million	baht	but	if	it	is	from	thailand	it	will	be	sold	at	million	baht
traffic	analytic	to	see	the	people	who	come	to	the	web	are	from	what	country	security	protection	help	prevent	hacking	information	from	hackers	for	example	if	your	ip	address	comes	from	strange	country
that	is	probably	not	customer	group	you	can	enter	block	command
lead	routing	for	example	when	selling	condos	to	foreigners	instead	of	hiring	sale	to	help	sell	they	use	method	of	hiring	country	agency	to	help	sell	instead	when	drop	lead	comes	to	the	website
the	system	will	send	the	name	contact	number	to	the	agency	to	help	sell	without	having	to	invest	in	opening	company
and	then	share	the	commission	with	the	agency	when	asked	what	marketing	technology	businessperson	start	should	using	first	khun	jittipong	suggested	that	for	small	companies	crm	should	be	in	place	for	order	management
but	if	company	has	lot	of	customers	who	want	to	focus	on	sending	emails	sending	sms	notifications	they	should	use	marketing	automation	or	use	erp	systems	to	manage	their	finances
key	takeawayo	define	data	foundation	asks	to	collect	important	information	first	such	as	how	much	is	the	budget

the	arrival	of	new	normal	due	to	the	covid	crisis	that	needs	to	be	maintained
social	distancing	changes	the	details	of	our	daily	lives	in	many	ways
one	of	them	includes	important	business	and	financial	transactions
which	law	has	approved	how	the	transaction	has	been	changed
mr	benja	suphannakun	partner	baker	mackenzie	company	limited	and	mr	sukit	udomsirikul	managing	director	of	research	siam	commercial	securities	company	limited	scbs	came	to	give	an	answer	on	this	issue
the	impact	of	covid	on	the	market	khun	benja	explains	that	when	the	epidemic	of	covid	sent	to	investors	from	originally	collecting	money	in	money	market	funds	bond	fund
there	was	concern	about	the	stability	of	the	fund	liquidity	and	therefore	turned	to	collect	cash	instead
resulting	in	panic	sell	selling	assets	and	investment	to	collect	cash
regarding	financial	institutions	it	was	affected	by	sme	business	debtors	and	retail	customers	who	suffered	from	the	inability	to	pay	their	debts
the	government	saw	the	impact	of	covid
broadly	towards	investors	sme	entrepreneurs	retail	customers	and	financial	institutions	therefore	measures	have	been	issued	to	help	both	the	capital	market	and	the	money	market
government	support	measures	in	capital	and	money	markets	for	the	capital	market	the	direct	impact	on	investors	is	the	selling	of	shares	due	to	panic	sell
therefore	the	criteria	have	been	adjusted	to	trading	suspension	circuit	breaker
previously	they	would	stop	trading	if	the	stock	market	closing	price	dropped	more	than	of	the	previous	day	closing	price
and	if	that	day	comes	back	to	buy	and	sell	again	the	price	further	reduced	more	than	of	the	previous	closing	price
can	break	for	one	more	round
became	trading	stop	if	the	stock	market	closing	price	fell	more	than	of	the	previous	day	closing	price
and	will	be	able	to	brake	again	if	the	price	for	that	day	drops	more	than	of	the	previous	closing	price
the	stock	exchange	of	thailand	will	use	the	new	circuit	breaker	criteria	until	june	and	from	news	about	the	sale	of	investment	units	in	fixed	income	assets	causing	many	bond	funds	to	close
therefore	there	is	fund	to	maintain	liquidity	in	the	bond	market	raising	bsf	is	another	measure	that	the	bot	issued	to	help	issuers	to	raise	enough	funds	to	bring
money	refinances	repayment	of	previously	issued	debentures	due
which	the	bot	requires	issuer	to	raise	funds	from	traditional	channels	such	as	issuing	new	debentures	loans	from	financial	institutions	increase	capital	from	shareholders	not	less	than	of	the	credit	limit	required	to	refinance
and	can	then	ask	for	help	from	the	bsf	fund	for	the	money	that	is	still	lacking	by	issuing	only	issue	bonds	not	over	days
the	investment	grade	was	rated	to	be	sold	to	the	bsf
the	bot	measure	on	the	bf	was	to	extend	the	liquidity	of	the	organization	through	the	crisis
as	for	the	capital	market	measures	the	bot	came	out	due	to	the	event	that	investors	lack	confidence	and	want	to	hold	cash	leading	to	the	sale	of	investment	units	of	debt	until	the	fund	must	close	although	the	fund	holds	good	quality	assets
this	includes	expanding	the	scope	of	measures	to	assist	mutual	funds	affected	by	the	lack	of	liquidity	in	the	financial	market	mutual	fund	liquidity	facility	mflf
the	bank	can	use	the	money	to	buy	investment	units	of	the	fixed	income	fund	or	buy	investment	units	with	promise	to	repurchase	in	the	future	repo
this	measure	causes	the	fund	to	receive	money	from	the	bank	to	pay	to	investors	who	want	to	redeem	the	investment	units

no	more	that	good	location	means	good	selling	since	online	shopping	is	the	exact	service	shoppers	are	looking	for	not	only	that	it	is	without	complication	but	in	certain	cases	it	allows	salaried	workers	to	earn	additional	incomes	especially	those	whod	like	to	deal	with	foreign	markets

those	whod	like	to	be	in	the	heart	of	chinese	shoppers	should	post	in	tmall	com	for	either	food	products	luxurious	brands	fashion	dresses	shoes	and	other	items
or	else	try	to	view	market	places	at	global	jd	com	the	popular	website	among	chinese	shoppers	who	looking	for	mother	and	child	products	health	and	beauty	care	fashion	wears	and	even	electronics

penetrating	this	channel	of	hundred	millions	customers	might	avail	you	high	chance	to	approach	your	waiting	customers
we	will	now	turn	to	india	the	land	of	some	million	people	lesser	than	that	of	china

another	interesting	websites	are	flipkart	com	the	one	for	selling	various	goods	but	the	most	hit	item	is	still	electronics
and	paytmmall	com	where	all	consumer	goods	are	available	and	highlighted	by	home	decoration	products	clothing	and	of	course	electronics	items
more	closer	to	us	in	asean	is	indonesia	of	over	million	population	and	with	economic	prosperity	to	enhance	people	spending	for	shopping
for	those	who	sell	fashion	goods	children	toys	and	goods	for	buyers	to	make	the	finished	model	by	themselves	should	try	this	online	popular	market	highly	visited	by	indonesian	shoppers	through	the	following	websites	lazada	co	id	blibli	com	and	elevenia	co	id	no	one	should	overlook	vietnam	where	its	million	population	mainly	favor	thai	products	since	they	do	trust	in	high	quality
that	is	why	touring	programs	for	vietnamese	tourists	in	thailand	must	be	with	super	market	shopping	agendas
moreover	due	to	the	vietnamese	growing	economy	the	online	shopping	proportion	by	its	new	generation	is	also	larger	for	electronics	items	and	fashion	items
the	popular	websites	for	this	shopping	group	are	lazada	vn	followed	by	thegioididong	com	and	vatgia	com	as	example
the	last	country	is	at	thailand	bordering	line	myanmar	with	over	millions	population	and	rapid	growing	economy	to	enhance	online	shopping
the	most	popular	products	for	online	shopping	is	firstly	it	equipment	followed	by	kitchen	wears	which	are	the	favorite	items	for	myanmar	shoppers

the	wide	you	look	for	marketing	places	youll	find	the	endless	trading	opportunity
but	prior	to	penetrating	each	specific	market	dont	forget	to	study	the	buyers	behavior	their	needs	and	even	their	tests	so	that	your	goods	wouldnt	be	lonely	hanging
the	important	matter	is	being	well	aware	of	all	trading	conditions
existing	storages	transportation	services	trading	procedure	for	fees	payment	and	the	required	commission	for	each	specific	website	how	to	pay	for	goods	in	each	respective	country	and	what	is	the	most	accepted	practice	there	etc
eventually	all	currencies	are	therefore	ready	to	flow	in	to	top	up	your	selling	with	the	lesser	risk	for	not	relying	on	only	one	specific	market
the	continuation	of	the	covid	situation	for	more	than	two	years	and	the	emergence	of	new	variants	have	encouraged	businesses	throughout	the	world	to	utilize	technology	to	stimulate	economic	growth
while	we	are	in	the	midst	of	lockdown	in	an	effort	to	restrict	new	outbreaks	the	economy	and	companies	must	function	as	usual
in	cambodia	ninety	percent	of	the	economy	is	driven	by	the	us	dollar	which	was	employed	in	the	early	stages	of	the	country	post	war	reconstruction
cambodians	tend	to	dislike	using	the	indigenous	currency	the	riel	and	presently	the	nation	has	one	of	the	highest	rates	of	dollar	usage	in	the	world	outside	of	the	usa

as	we	know	that	online	business	or	online	marketing	is	now	must	for	both	smes	and	large	businesses
competition	in	the	online	world	is	high	and	tons	of	content	is	in	the	eyes	of	consumers	every	day
how	can	we	create	catchy	content	to	attract	consumers	as	there	is	an	abundance	of	choices	in	this	era
here	we	have	great	tips	for	writing	great	content	to	hook	target	groups	and	grow	sales
winning	zone	good	content	must	be	in	winning	zone	which	is	the	core	where	our	products	meet	consumer	needs
we	have	to	tell	things	that	customers	want	to	know	and	that	we	can	possibly	do	them
this	means	our	story	is	relevant	to	customer	interest
often	we	produce	some	content	unrelated	to	the	target	group	and	irrelevant	to	customer	needs	or	advertising	doesnt	hit	your	target
great	content	should	start	with	finding	customer	needs	and	using	our	products	or	services	as	solution	to	solve	the	right	problems
clear	objectives	when	customers	dont	quite	understand	content	with	unclear	objectives	we	wont	be	able	to	measure	anything
suppose	you	could	make	wish	for	this	content	what	would	it	be
before	creating	content	ask	yourself	what	do	you	want	to	gain	from	that	content	likes	shares	leads	or	sales
change	from	products	features	to	solution	to	solve	customer	problems	good	content	should	start	with	why	all	content	must	respond	to	the	following	questions
above	all	content	should	consist	of	functions	and	must	end	in	one	content
good	content	doesnt	have	to	belong	but	the	story	must	be	fully	complete
things	to	be	concerned	about	are	what	is	solution	for	buying	piece	of	cosmetic
what	is	the	difference	between	our	brand	and	others
what	is	the	promotion	for	buying	this	product	now
be	reminded	that	content	doesnt	tell	customers	what	youre	selling	itd	rather	tell	them	how	to	solve	their	problems	and	who	will	get	help
content	is	problem	solution
our	products	or	services	are	solutions	or	key	in	solving	problems
our	duty	is	to	provide	solution	by	introducing	concept	why	buy
why	you
why	now
the	composition	of	content	punch	headline	to	draw	attention	must	do	for	writing	either	online	or	offline	content	is	stunning	headline	or	title	to	catch	your	readers	eyes
here	are	ways	to	name	your	title
once	we	finished	learning	basic	principles	the	next	step	is	to	take	action	and	then	the	results	will	lead	to	measurements	and	evaluations	whether	our	strategies	work	well
after	that	we	will	improve	our	lesson	learned	to	create	content	that	hits	each	target	group
learn	take	action	evaluate	improve	and	success	will	be	within	your	reach
professional	and	comprehensive	business	management	solution
in	the	new	normal	doing	traditional	business	may	no	longer	meet	market	needs	and	create	sustainable	growth
consumer	behaviors	have	changed	and	therere	multi	channel	to	approach	products	and	services	especially	after	the	covid	pandemic	that	customers	have	continually	shifted	product	ordering	to	online
to	sustain	the	business	we	need	to	shift	it	to	digital	sme	and	merge	online	and	offline	appropriately
those	who	never	have	experience	in	online	business	may	worry	about	when	and	how	to	start	it
unfortunately	we	have	good	advice	from	sellsuki	management	expert	for	online	smes	with	tips	about	omni	channels	to	blend	offline	and	online	marketing	effectively
when	should	we	start	an	online	business
right	away	is	the	answer
most	people	may	think	that	covid	is	crisis	but	online	can	turn	crisis	into	an	opportunity
people	spend	less	time	making	decisions	for	online	purchases	and	they	intend	to	buy	products
besides	the	number	of	online	marketing	transactions	are	increased
in	may	commerce	and	purchasing	decisions	reached	its	peak
and	when	the	lockdown	was	released	sales	reduced	accordingly
that	means	people	have	changed	their	behaviors	and	online	started	becoming	popular
the	top	selling	product	over	the	crisis	is	exercise	equipment	following	by	supermarket	products	and	computer	accessories	respectively
an	opportunity	is	here
covid	is	not	crisis	for	everyone
with	online	as	tool	entrepreneurs	can	turn	the	crisis	into	an	opportunity	by	shifting	sme	to	digital	sme	and	we	have	seen	the	most	growth	in	many	businesses	during	the	pandemic
the	analysis	by	google	trend	about	commerce	and	logistics	from	reveals	that	both	businesses	were	growing	by	leaps	and	bounds	especially	food	delivery
the	online	world	after	covid	is	called	next	to	normal
good	combination	of	online	and	offline	can	grow	business	effectively
for	example	sme	who	is	dealer	of	electrical	appliances	and	open	sales	booth	in	the	events	with	no	experience	online
after	that	he	created	his	online	brand	facebook	and	have	sold	products	through	market	place	with	community	content	creation
the	content	includes	fun	facts	knowledge	about	electrical	goods	and	gains	customer	perception	and	brand	recognition
whenever	customers	want	to	buy	those	products	this	brand	will	pop	up
this	electrical	company	used	to	join	the	event	every	year
however	as	thai	sme	the	owner	cant	compete	with	bigger	brands	who	sell	similar	products	in	the	same	event
this	sme	can	use	online	tools	to	fight	big	brands	by	creating	online	campaigns	creating	traffic	from	online	that	drives	customers	to	buy	products	in	the	event	offering	online	discounts	that	can	be	used	for	offline	purchases
another	example	is	to	use	influencer
thai	brand	that	sells	sneakers	with	no	experience	in	the	online	market
the	owner	launched	campaign	and	wanted	the	audience	who	went	to	the	event	wearing	series	of	shoes
the	problem	is	the	production	of	these	shoes	will	be	finished	few	days	before	the	event	starts
normally	it	takes	while	for	customers	to	buy	shoes	offline	so	website	is	created	to	get	preordering	from	customers	and	shoes	will	be	delivered	to	them	in	time	of	the	event	so	theyre	able	to	wear	those	shoes	to	the	event
in	fact	only	website	cant	draw	much	interest	for	the	online	market	and	using	an	influencer	will	do
as	the	company	has	its	brand	ambassador	adding	the	power	of	secondary	influencers	can	spread	the	news	faster	and	will	lead	to	successful	campaign
the	above	mentioned	is	the	offline	case	that	used	online	as	tool	to	scale	up	the	business
scale	up	is	an	adjustment	of	the	work	process	and	cost	structure	by	reducing	fixed	costs	as	much	as	possible
some	people	may	understand	that	scale	up	is	growth	but	its	not
growth	is	an	increase	in	income	but	scale	up	is	work	adjustment
online	is	also	an	adjustment	of	work	process	and	organizational	structure	to	drive	sustainable	growth	at	certain	level
for	example	if	we	set	cost	structure	and	good	organizational	structure	we	can	catch	marketing	trends	such	as	the	sale	trend
statistics	show	sales	growth	in	all	platforms	in	one	day
if	the	organization	is	ready	to	grow	at	peak	time	it	can	follow	this	trend
anyway	while	on	this	trend	challenges	occurred	because	of	insufficient	production	capacity	lack	of	administration	and	packing	staff	or	ineffective	management	that	cant	keep	customer	data
solution	is	to	use	skilled	outsource	to	help	managing	works
even	when	orders	are	in	the	highest	volume	the	fixed	costs	can	be	reduced
every	time	that	the	company	creates	advertising	orders	will	keep	coming	in
how	do	we	keep	the	customers
how	can	we	make	customers	repeat	purchases
repeat	purchase	is	important	because	of	repeatable	sustainable	profit
repeat	purchase	will	be	possible	if	we	know	our	customers	well
to	know	them	we	need	good	crm	so	that	we	know	who	they	are	what	they	buy	their	buying	frequency	and	when	they	buy
crm	helps	us	keep	customer	data	and	data	is	factor	for	better	decision
if	we	know	customers	and	their	preferences	we	can	create	social	media	content	that	matches	their	interests	which	may	lead	to	more	purchases
or	if	we	offer	attractive	promotions	repeat	purchases	will	happen
theres	free	feature	in	line	oa	to	create	crm	for	customers	and	can	keep	customer	data	which	is	called	chat	tag
when	staff	chat	with	customers	the	tag	will	show	so	we	know	customer	details
for	example	today	customer	buys	shirt	then	the	tag	indicates	shirt
customer	buys	pants	tag	states	pants
customer	makes	fast	money	transfer	tag	states	fast	transfer
when	therere	many	tags	our	communication	will	reach	the	right	customer	group
if	we	have	promotions	about	shirts	we	can	deliver	our	messages	to	those	who	have	shirt	tags	only
that	mechanism	helps	generate	repeat	purchases
when	data	is	available	what	to	do	next
the	answer	is	to	analyze	that	data	and	identify	who	customers	are	and	what	they	like
sometimes	there	may	be	problems	with	data	we	can	recollect	data	and	see	if	it	works
the	data	process	is	quite	dynamic	and	we	need	to	repeat	it	continually	to	keep	the	business	strong	and	sustainable
we	call	this	process	agile	marketing
here	are	the	checklists	to	scale	up	business	for	generating	sustainable	profit	understand	products	market	competitors	and	customer	needs	but	you	must	find	marketing	gap	which	is	the	point	where	markets	have	demand	and	customers	need	products
it	must	be	the	point	that	competitors	dont	have
if	you	can	make	it	you	can	better	serve	the	needs	of	both	market	and	customers
communication	communication	is	divided	into	three	channels	owned	media	media	publisher	and	influencer
we	find	plenty	of	owned	media	in	social	media	and	website	so	its	no	need	to	create	owned	media	in	all	channels
facebook	is	good	for	mass	products	line	fits	elderly	or	aging	products	ig	is	best	for	innovation	products	or	attractive	images	that	can	boost	sales	twitter	and	tiktok	are	good	for	catching	men	or	teenage	groups
media	publisher	includes	all	online	advertising
pantip	is	content	or	articles	consisting	of	keywords	for	easy	search
influencer	is	shortcut	key	that	makes	people	know	your	brand	faster	including	many	sizes	such	as	nano	micro	macro	co	page	or	youtuber
online	sales	channels	are	available	on	websites	social	media	and	market	place
choose	familiar	channel	or	channel	that	mostly	fits	customers
how	will	you	deliver	products	to	customers
would	it	be	self	manufacturing	or	outsource	production
would	products	be	self	stock	or	keep	in	warehouse
how	do	you	manage	stocks
would	it	be	excel	calculation	or	standard	management
how	products	are	packed
omni	channel	is	proven	example	that	online	can	extend	to	offline	and	helps	grow	business	and	scale	up
good	example	is	camp	cloth	shop	that	combines	plenty	of	thai	cloth	brands	to	create	multi	brand
camps	first	branch	is	at	siam
all	people	who	own	brands	want	to	open	offline	shops	there	but	the	rent	costs	one	hundred	thousand	baht	per	month
anyway	if	brands	are	merged	the	rent	may	drop	to	ten	thousand	baht
the	difference	is	we	will	gain	only	customers	who	know	our	brand	if	we	open	just	one	shop	while	multi	brand	provides	chance	for	customers	to	know	some	other	brands	when	they	go	to	physical	shop	for	self	experience	or	cloth	trial
most	women	will	attract	to	pretty	stuff	and	often	repeat	purchases
everyone	then	creates	traffic	from	online	to	shop	and	cross	selling	happens
after	that	online	would	need	offline	as	an	extended	purchase	channel
therefore	offline	will	meet	the	needs	of	some	customer	groups	and	can	increase	sales	and	upselling
online	and	offline	blend	well	and	support	each	other
entrepreneurs	who	want	to	step	into	digital	smes	need	to	understand	consumer	behaviors	that	have	been	changed	and	consider	how	to	grow	their	businesses	in	the	next	normal
be	agile	by	setting	up	business	structure	to	minimize	fixed	costs	and	adjust	to	variable	costs
after	that	start	gathering	customer	data	and	arrange	crm	to	promote	repeat	purchases	for	gaining	sustainable	profit

storytelling	is	an	important	factor	of	content	marketing
it	is	marketing	strategy	that	allows	service	and	products	to	moderately	win	the	heart	of	the	consumers	without	their	resistance
this	is	because	fundamentally	people	dislike	things	to	be	forced	into	them
in	nia	scb	ibe	innovation	based	enterprise	course	by	nia	and	scb	mr	sutirapan	sakkawatra	evp	head	of	marketing	from	siam	commercial	bank	reveals	the	power	of	storytelling	that	can	magically	convince	people
the	heart	of	marketing	is	to	search	for	possibilities	from	fogg	behaviour	model	theory	mat	mr	sutirapan	concluded	the	core	of	marketing	that	the	action	of	buying	or	which	stands	for	behaviour	can	happen	if	these	factors	happen	namely	motivation	ability	and	trigger
when	these	factors	come	together	perfectly	the	area	above	the	graph	mat	is	the	possibility	that	people	will	purchase	the	product
the	duty	of	marketing	expert	is	to	find	the	potential	customers	in	the	area	of	possibility	find	the	right	person	right	customer	or	shift	people	from	below	the	graph	to	above	the	graph
key	to	trigger	customers	it	might	appear	that	mat	graph	is	not	complicated	however	practically	solution	cannot	be	obtained	easily	if	there	is	no	complete	understanding	of	the	marketing	strategy
mr	sutirapan	explained	on	the	marketing	strategy	that	will	be	the	key	to	solve	the	problem	of	why	customers	are	not	triggered	media	strategy	there	must	be	consideration	of	whether	the	methods	of	conveying	the	message	can	get	through	the	target	group
there	are	types	of	media	which	are	paid	media	owned	media	and	earned	media
paid	media	display	ad	search	ad	and	native	advertising	and	earned	media	conversation	brand	placement	blogs	and	social	network	will	help	to	establish	brand	awareness
as	for	owned	media	website	branded	content	social	pages	it	will	create	brand	experience	for	consumers
nevertheless	sending	message	to	the	market	must	be	done	in	an	appropriate	manner	to	reach	the	relevant	target	group	so	that	the	desired	result	can	be	obtained
call	to	action	or	cta	strategy	that	improves	ability	to	do	is	to	make	the	buying	process	as	easy	as	possible
for	example	cta	of	bank	business	in	the	past	is	to	go	to	branches	to	enquire	about	account	related	issues	and	it	took	much	effort	from	the	consumers
later	on	cta	was	moved	to	call	center	website	and	eventually	banking
just	like	scb	that	cta	such	as	request	for	loan	apply	for	the	credit	card	open	an	account	etc	can	be	done	through	scb	easy	app	anywhere	and	anytime
this	can	be	seen	that	good	cta	can	actually	help	to	improve	the	business	situation
content	strategy	strategy	to	convince	consumers	to	increase	the	motivational	levels	in	buying
it	will	change	cold	customers	to	warm	customers	and	when	the	motivational	level	has	reached	its	peak	they	will	turn	into	hot	customers	that	are	ready	to	buy	products	when	received	the	message	with	suitable	media	strategy
start	with	why	let	us	go	in	depth	in	content	strategy	mr	sutirapan	took	jordan	belfort	former	stockbroker	as	an	example
belforts	story	was	featured	in	the	movie	the	wolf	of	wall	street
his	selling	topic	is	sell	me	this	pen
most	of	the	people	will	start	the	conversation	with	the	properties	of	this	pen	for	example	this	is	beautiful	pen	or	this	is	high	quality	pen	which	is	start	with	what	story
however	effective	selling	is	to	start	the	conversation	with	why	giving	reason	the	pen	should	be	bought
this	is	process	of	creating	demand	or	increasing	the	level	of	motivation	in	buying	with	storytelling
the	powerful	storytelling	is	to	tell	the	story	of	the	identifiable	victims	not	just	statistical	victims
for	instant	the	fundraising	for	unfortunate	children	in	africa	the	heart	wrenching	story	of	rokia	an	year	old	unfortunate	african	girl	will	be	able	to	raise	more	money	compared	to	the	true	story	of	millions	of	african	children	lacking	food
why	is	it	so
according	to	the	experiment	tragic	story	of	russian	lady	was	recorded	and	her	brain	was	scanned	to	observe	how	it	functions	while	she	is	telling	the	story
when	the	story	was	translated	into	the	english	language	and	shown	to	americans	to	watch	their	brains	were	scanned	to	see	how	they	function	while	listening	to	the	story
the	result	came	out	that	american	listeners	brain	function	similar	to	the	russian	ladys
this	shows	that	there	is	connection	between	the	story	told	and	the	human	brain
what	follows	is	the	feeling	of	trust	and	story	is	better	remembered
if	this	was	to	explain	in	scientific	term	the	amygdala	will	release	chemical	to	cover	the	frontal	lobe	which	makes	people	use	emotion	more	than	reason
storytelling	in	the	marketing	aspect	is	the	creation	of	images	in	peoples	minds	making	use	of	the	amygdala	to	trigger	emotions	allowing	customers	to	feel	the	story	and	remember	the	message	that	the	brand	wants	to	convey
marketing	is	to	transform	people	mr	sutirapan	sees	the	customer	journey	of	each	product	as	unique
different	groups	of	products	will	have	different	customer	journeys
the	most	important	thing	lies	upon	the	principle	of	trigger	motivation	ability	that	changes	customers	in	each	step	from	awareness	consideration	purchase	retention	advocacy
mr	sutirapan	emphasizes	that	marketing	is	to	transform	the	human	mind	with	marketing	techniques
from	dislike	to	like	from	indifferent	to	love	from	unwanted	to	needed
these	can	be	achieved	by	utilizing	attractive	content	this	kind	of	content	will	have	to	match	the	main	theme	of	the	product	emotional	rational	and	the	desired	marketing	goal	at	that	time	which	varies	from	creating	awareness	to	purchase
for	example	in	the	creation	of	awareness	if	the	selling	point	of	the	product	is	based	on	emotion	the	content	has	to	be	entertaining	like	viral	clips	or	quiz	games
in	the	creation	of	purchase	however	the	content	should	be	inspiring	to	lead	people	to	buy	the	product	like	review	endorsement	etc
if	it	is	product	with	rational	selling	point	like	high	valued	product	educational	content	like	articles	info	graphic	trend	report	or	demo	video	should	be	used
awareness	creation	will	be	convincing	content	like	rating	case	studies	product	features	datasheets	etc
why	buy	can	be	created	with	good	story	the	good	story	consists	of	factors	which	are	the	beginning	the	ending	and	the	ability	to	change	people	with	the	theme	as	the	heart	of	the	story
also	it	should	come	with	strong	plot	and	the	plot	that	will	most	affect	people	will	be	life	story	that	will	break	peoples	hearts	and	heal	them
the	story	can	start	from	completely	normal	day	along	the	happiness	line
suddenly	calamity	strikes
happiness	just	collapses	and	no	matter	how	much	one	tries	to	get	back	up	they	just	keep	falling	down	and	hurts	even	more	badly
then	the	story	comes	to	the	peak	where	there	seems	to	be	no	hope	but	the	magical	power	or	the	solution	to	the	problem	is	found	and	used	to	bring	back	peace	or	happiness	again
there	comes	happy	ending
plot	consists	of	from	ancient	times	human	is	hunter	during	the	day	and	storyteller	during	the	night
the	mural	painting	on	the	cave	wall	is	pictorial	evidence	of	how	the	ancestors	passed	down	the	story	of	hunting	to	the	rest	of	the	group	members
later	on	it	developed	into	language	that	expresses	thoughts	and	knowledge	to	society
mr	sutirapan	concluded	the	power	of	storytelling	that	the	successful	leaders	of	the	religions	and	politicians	are	all	great	storytellers	because	storytelling	has	the	power	to	transform	people	and	this	makes	storytelling	an	important	tool	to	create	widespread	content	marketing	in	present	society

new	digital	banking	platform	for	enhancing	the	good	financial	experience	for	business	customers
influencer	marketing	is	one	of	the	marketing	strategies	that	brands	and	agencies	commonly	use	because	it	gets	straight	to	the	target	groups	and	customers	nowadays	who	have	more	trust	in	reviews	or	online	comments	than	the	information	provided	by	the	brand
and	the	main	platforms	that	both	brands	and	agencies	commonly	use	is	none	other	than	facebook
influencers	who	work	together	with	brands	or	agencies	might	be	asked	to	create	branded	content	on	facebook
the	novel	influencers	who	work	with	brands	for	the	first	time	or	have	never	used	this	function	before	might	have	no	idea	of	what	facebook	branded	content	is
how	to	use	it
what	they	have	to	do
what	the	benefits	are	and	influencers	might	wonder	if	they	should	use	it	or	not
in	this	article	let	us	get	to	know	more	about	facebook	branded	content
what	is	facebook	branded	content
branded	content	is	tool	that	allows	influencers	or	content	creators	on	facebook	to	tag	sponsor	brands	on	their	content
the	objective	is	to	announce	that	the	content	collaborates	between	the	brand	and	facebook	influencer	who	is	the	administrator	of	the	page
brands	or	agencies	can	view	numeral	information	of	that	particular	post	and	partly	it	is	to	show	transparency	as	page	followers	will	immediately	know	that	the	post	is	being	sponsored	by	brands	and	not	the	usual	post	that	is	the	administrators	review
if	we	look	at	the	definition	given	by	facebook	branded	content	is	creator	or	publishers	content	that	features	or	is	influenced	by	business	partner	for	an	exchange	of	value	or	to	say	it	bluntly	it	is	simply	tie	in
in	which	mark	zuckerberg	mentioned	that	this	feature	is	created	to	establish	transparency	in	facebook	community	and	clearly	show	which	posts	are	advertisements	and	which	are	normal	content
what	are	the	benefits	of	branded	content
before	facebook	offered	branded	content	feature	general	users	could	hardly	tell	if	the	post	was	an	advertisement	without	the	administrator	mentioning	that	it	was	sponsored	post
however	with	the	branded	content	feature	viewers	will	instantly	be	informed	that	the	post	is	an	advertisement
this	helps	to	create	transparency
besides	before	having	branded	content	if	the	brand	owner	wanted	to	boost	post	by	themselves	they	had	to	become	an	advertiser	in	the	page	and	sometimes	influencers	did	not	really	like	it	as	advertisers	are	allowed	access	to	the	numeral	information	of	the	page
another	case	was	that	the	brand	would	include	the	cost	of	boosting	the	post	into	the	post	creation	pay
this	way	of	working	has	many	downsides	such	as	lacking	post	insights	as	brand	cannot	access	the	post	insights	like	reach	impression	likes	photo	views	and	video	views	and	duration	of	viewing	in	case	of	video	post
apart	from	that	influencers	might	choose	to	boost	the	advertisement	with	the	target	groups	that	the	brand	does	not	need
for	example	brand	wants	to	advertise	to	target	audience	under	the	custom	audience	tool	of	their	brand	etc
another	problem	is	that	influencers	had	to	make	report	to	the	brand	of	the	number	of	reaches	and	the	concluded	information
if	there	was	an	advertisement	they	had	to	make	report	of	advertisement	insights	and	send	it	to	the	brand	which	is	really	time	consuming	for	influencers
but	with	branded	content	the	brand	can	boost	post	and	sees	insights	of	only	posts	that	the	brand	is	being	tagged	which	is	good	deal	for	both	parties
how	to	use	facebook	branded	content	step	if	page	has	never	activated	branded	content	go	to	and	choose	the	desired	page
then	press	send	for	facebook	to	approve
the	registration	can	only	be	done	once
after	the	page	has	registered	facebook	will	approve	within	hours	and	the	notification	will	be	sent	to	the	page
step	after	the	approval	the	holding	hands	icon	will	appear	while	creating	post
if	the	administrator	wants	to	activate	branded	content	click	on	the	icon
step	there	will	be	with	option	to	choose	the	page	of	the	brand	that	the	influencer	wants	to	tag	and	only	one	page	can	be	selected
there	is	also	an	option	whether	the	influencer	wants	to	allow	the	brand	to	boost	the	post	or	not
after	tagging	and	posting	the	name	of	the	brand	will	appear	with	the	word	sponsored	and	the	job	is	done	for	the	page	administrator
step	the	page	administrator	of	the	brand	will	receive	request	branded	content	notification	from	the	publisher	or	influencer
the	brand	will	then	able	to	see	the	post	insights	with	the	boost	post	button	or	the	brand	can	go	to	ads	manager	to	view	and	select	the	branded	contents	to	advertise
not	only	the	brand	has	an	access	to	information	but	the	tagged	posts	will	also	allow	customers	to	easily	get	to	the	brand	like	the	page	and	order	the	products
as	for	the	publisher	they	will	be	able	to	see	the	result	or	number	of	post	boosting	advertisement	detail	ranging	from	audience	to	the	cost
both	parties	can	then	rest	assure	as	they	can	see	what	have	been	done	with	this	transparency
what	kinds	of	post	that	can	use	branded	content
it	can	be	seen	that	branded	content	gives	benefits	to	all	parties
page	administrator	or	influencer	will	not	have	to	buy	ads	and	boost	post	themselves	and	needs	not	to	make	report	to	the	brand
at	the	same	time	the	brand	can	directly	access	the	insights	of	the	past	as	well	as	the	information	of	various	advertisements
also	customers	as	general	users	will	be	able	to	clearly	distinguish	if	the	content	is	an	advertisement	and	not	the	review	by	the	influencer

china	is	stepping	forward	to	be	the	worlds	economic	superpower	and	holds	major	role	in	driving	the	world	economy	as	both	manufacturer	and	large	consumers	of	the	world
another	role	is	being	an	investor	who	has	invested	massive	amount	of	money	in	many	countries
khun	manop	sangiambut	first	executive	vice	president	and	chief	financial	officer	at	scb	has	analyzed	the	investment	trend	of	china	in	thailand	and	believes	that	china	views	thailand	as	high	potential	country	for	being	trade	center	for	the	asean	market
china	applied	for	the	no	investment	in	thailand	in	according	to	the	report	of	the	board	of	investment	of	thailand	boi	china	applied	for	receiving	the	boi	investment	promotion	in	for	the	first	time	with	the	highest	cost	in	history
and	then	in	chinas	rank	was	times	away	from	the	second	country	and	became	the	first	country	that	applied	for	receiving	the	boi	investment	promotion	at	hundred	billion	baht	covering	projects	an	average	of	billion	baht	per	project
even	though	china	faced	covid	crisis	over	the	first	half	of	they	invested	projects	in	thailand
however	the	chinese	government	has	managed	to	control	the	pandemic	effectively	so	china	could	recover	rapidly	and	before	another	country
presumably	the	investment	value	from	chinese	investors	will	be	resumed	highly	to	normal	for	the	rest	of	more	chinese	investors	want	to	visit	thailand	china	business	development	scb	incorporated	with	economic	intelligence	center	eic	conducted	survey	on	the	investment	direction	of	chinese	investors	in	thailand	after	covid
the	interview	was	arranged	with	top	executives	of	large	and	medium	chinese	enterprises	located	in	both	china	and	thailand
the	finding	is	more	than	of	chinese	investors	are	interested	in	extending	investment	to	thailand	within	years
surprisingly	represent	those	who	have	never	invested	or	run	business	in	thailand	before
they	consider	thailand	potential	market	with	the	readiness	and	capability	to	become	the	asean	center	to	connect	the	market	to	neighboring	countries
unlike	in	the	past	thailand	was	viewed	as	only	the	manufacturing	base	for	export
besides	of	the	interviewees	have	planned	to	increase	their	investment	in	thailand
chinese	investors	are	likely	to	adjust	their	investment	structure	in	thailand	from	high	investment	industry	to	lower	and	focus	on	service	industry	and	technology
this	new	trend	is	quite	challenging	for	thai	entrepreneurs	who	will	face	competitors	who	own	lower	cost	and	more	advanced	technology	including	experience	in	the	highly	competitive	market	in	china
from	this	survey	investment	is	likely	increasing	exponentially	and	significantly	spreading	more	than	expected
the	investment	wont	be	clustered	in	old	business	anymore	such	as	large	investment	to	build	manufacturing	base	for	export
the	structure	has	changed	to	smaller	investments	in	various	businesses	like	service	business	logistics	technology	it	including	industrial	supply	chains	of	emerging	business
even	though	investment	value	putting	in	each	project	wont	be	as	much	as	before	but	therell	be	lots	more	projects	and	connections	with	the	business	sector	and	thai	economy	coming	in
believe	that	after	years	of	the	post	pandemic	travel	will	be	back	to	normal	and	the	huge	amount	of	financial	investment	from	china	in	thailand	will	be	much	rising	said	khun	manop
khun	manop	stated	main	reasons	that	the	chinese	investment	structure	in	thailand	has	been	adjusted	from	clustering	to	spreading	investment
chinese	economy	was	adjusted	over	years	ago	spreading	from	large	industry	to	service	and	consumption	so	the	economic	structure	has	greatly	changed	and	has	an	impact	on	chinese	investment	overseas
china	has	launched	lots	of	new	consumer	good	brands	with	world	quality	at	affordable	prices	and	they	have	become	world	renowned	products
as	result	those	brands	foresee	an	opportunity	to	invest	and	open	their	market	in	thailand	and	other	asean	countries
china	has	invested	in	technology	development	in	both	ai	and	new	industries	such	as	substitute	energy	electric	car	etc
thats	why	chinese	investors	are	more	confident	to	develop	those	technologies	and	then	export	them	to	foreign	markets
factors	that	attract	chinese	to	invest	in	thailand	khun	manop	mentioned	about	factors	that	draw	interest	to	chinese	investors	to	thailand
market	potential	and	location	of	thailand	are	suitable	for	being	the	center	connecting	to	asean	countries	the	readiness	of	infrastructure	supportive	investment	policy	and	efficient	public	health
most	importantly	strong	relationship	between	thailand	and	china	from	higher	level	to	general	people	and	the	chinese	feel	warm	by	thais	friendliness	and	good	hospitality
there	is	conflict	situation	between	china	and	western	countries	especially	trade	war	and	technology	war	between	china	and	the	that	has	driven	chinese	investors	to	invest	more	in	the	asean	region	and	thailand
opportunity	and	challenge	of	thai	business	the	entering	of	chinese	investors	has	created	job	hiring	the	transition	of	knowledge	and	technology	that	enhance	value	driven	to	the	country	economy
in	addition	its	challenging	for	thai	entrepreneurs	to	face	competitors	who	have	more	advantages	in	lower	cost	and	advanced	technology
believe	that	thai	entrepreneurs	must	be	well	prepared	to	understand	the	nature	of	chinese	business	like	its	pattern	and	model	which	chinese	entrepreneurs	have	conducted	in	china	as	they	may	follow	those	principles	when	they	come	to	thailand	so	that	we	can	find	strategies	and	are	ready	to	cope	with	chinese	business
in	fact	more	coming	of	chinese	entrepreneurs	is	business	opportunity	but	not	challenge	or	risk	for	thai	entrepreneurs	said	khun	manop
thai	entrepreneurs	should	get	ready	to	handle	more	aggressive	competition	by	leveraging	the	manufacturing	process	with	technology	and	innovation	including	partnering	with	chinese	investors	to	extend	new	business	opportunity
fortunately	we	have	more	advantage	in	understanding	the	thai	consumer	market	local	law	and	regulations	and	are	capable	of	finding	raw	materials
more	thai	entrepreneurs	should	learn	the	chinese	language	and	understand	the	chinese	culture	as	that	would	support	thai	workers	and	other	entrepreneurs	to	find	an	opportunity	from	the	investors	at	their	full	potential

prefer	sitting	quietly	to	chatting
the	taxi	driver	started	introducing	himself	that	he	used	to	be	security	guard	at	government	unit
he	foresaw	that	his	income	wouldnt	make	his	living	until	retirement	so	he	decided	to	take	early	retirement	and	then	spent	retirement	allowance	for	buying	new	taxi	to	begin	new	career	as	an	independent	job
bought	this	car	instead	of	renting	as	its	good	value	for	money
the	car	installment	is	baht	per	month	with	an	average	of	baht	day	comparing	with	paying	car	rental	baht	day	equivalent	to	baht	per	month	with	year	installment	and	well	own	the	car	after	that	said	the	driver
when	calculating	the	total	is	baht	think	his	car	should	not	cost	more	than	million	baht
he	continued	his	talk	there	are	lot	more	expenses	like	departure	fee	registration	fee	and	grab	starting	fee
have	no	idea	what	grab	is	all	about
need	to	buy	installation	tools	and	learn	how	to	use	it
was	curious	so	asked	the	driver	more	and	knew	that	additional	to	car	installment	paid	to	the	car	center	he	still	has	big	expenses	comprising	registration	fee	baht	gas	installation	baht	taxi	fare	meter	and	mobile	radio	which	are	baht	in	total	insurance	baht	member	fee	for	taxi	finder	application	baht	including	accessories	like	smartphone	and	its	stand	and	some	managing	fees	charged	by	taxi	center
the	expense	altogether	is	baht	which	has	to	be	paid	on	the	departure	date
in	summary	the	taxi	driver	needs	to	invest	about	million	baht	in	order	to	be	new	business	owner
wondered	how	he	lives	his	life	these	days	can	earn	about	baht	day	and	eat	in	the	car	and	rent	house	to	share	with	others	to	save	money
his	quality	of	life	is	not	better	as	he	drives	every	day	to	collect	his	money	for	the	car	installation	fee
wanted	to	ask	him	more	but	it	was	time	to	get	off	the	car
from	his	story	we	can	separate	it	to	each	issue	as	follows
is	the	car	departure	expense	too	high
the	cost	of	the	car	by	installation	plan	with	the	care	center	is	as	high	as	million	baht	while	paying	cash	for	this	car	plus	departure	expense	should	be	less	than	million	baht
the	care	center	can	gain	profit	from	rental	fee	of	about	hundred	thousand	baht	per	car
when	completing	year	installment	plan	the	driver	owns	the	car
anyway	after	years	the	high	maintenance	fee	comes	with	car	condition
besides	the	driver	may	have	less	capability	to	make	money	as	passengers	will	need	new	taxi	with	better	condition
comparing	to	car	rental	by	paying	baht	daily	some	centers	may	offer	promotion	of	renting	get	or	renting	get	by	this	way	the	driver	doesnt	have	to	pay	full	rent	per	day	and	can	take	day	off	without	paying	the	rent
for	the	cost	of	living	if	the	driver	earns	days	baht	and	then	he	pays	car	installment	fee	of	he	still	has	baht	left	to	pay	for	food	house	rent	and	car	gas
would	that	be	enough
how	hard	he	has	to	work	until	he	can	gain	savings
the	quality	of	his	life	doesnt	seem	to	improve
in	summary	be	considerate	before	you	jump	into	any	investment	especially	to	risk	yourself	by	leaving	your	current	job	to	start	working	freelance	assuming	that	you	are	your	own	boss
think	carefully	about	your	income	and	expenses	at	present	and	in	the	future	including	cost	and	intangible	benefits	such	as	leisure	time	and	happiness	at	work
comparing	related	factors	thoroughly	as	it	may	be	impossible	to	revert	back	to	the	old	ways	after	you	go	the	wrong	way
professional	and	comprehensive	business	management	solution
coffee	talk	series	ep	china	is	one	of	the	top	worlds	market	that	attracts	business	from	countries	all	over	the	world
especially	in	recent	years	chinese	peoples	buying	power	is	increasing	and	this	increases	chances	for	people	to	do	business	in	the	chinese	market
cross	border	commerce	or	cbec	in	short	is	another	business	channel	that	is	growing	tremendously	and	has	high	sales	volume
scb	held	coffee	talk	series	panel	with	pimkwan	aditapsatit	avp	china	business	development	scb	and	chinese	business	specialist	invited	to	share	her	knowledge	on	chinese	cebc	for	sme	entrepreneurs
there	are	several	interesting	points	shared	in	the	panel
overall	of	chinese	commerce	access	to	the	internet	is	the	basis	of	commerce	market
according	to	the	data	collected	in	of	billion	chinese	residents	have	an	access	to	the	internet	which	is	equivalent	to	million	people	with	of	internet	access	through	mobile	phones
thus	it	can	be	said	that	china	is	mobile	first	country
in	this	quantity	of	mobile	phone	users	uses	for	social	media	uses	online	chatting	and	million	people	are	commerce	online	purchasers	with	annual	sales	of	trillion	us	dollars	in	this	is	of	the	worlds	commerce	market
it	is	expected	that	chinese	commerce	consumers	will	increase	in	years	and	million	commerce	customers	are	only	equivalent	to	of	the	chinese	retail	market
this	shows	that	the	chinese	online	market	is	still	growing	and	according	to	the	same	information	there	are	chinese	consumers	that	like	travel	and	buy	online	goods	from	overseas	and	up	to	million	people	are	cbec	customers
normal	trade	vs	cbec	which	should	we	go	for
there	are	methods	of	importing	goods	into	china	namely	are	normal	trade	and	cbec
normal	trade	will	be	divided	into	offline	sell	in	original	retail	stores	and	online	and	through	chinese	websites	such	as	alibaba	com	tmall	com	taobao	com	etc
on	the	other	hand	cbec	is	divided	into	online	sales	and	through	comprehensive	platform	single	platform	with	variety	of	goods	and	vertical	platform	niche	market	platform
as	for	the	question	on	the	differences	of	the	online	platform	of	normal	trade	and	cbec	the	answer	lies	in	the	rules	that	are	more	lenient	on	cbec
for	example	important	licencing	chinese	label	approval	application	as	well	as	the	differences	in	tax	rates	import	duties	consumption	tax	vat	etc
also	there	is	an	annual	purchase	limitation	in	chinese	cbec	each	not	exceeding	rmb	per	order	or	rmb	per	year
therefore	entrepreneurs	have	to	consider	thoroughly	on	various	factors	to	choose	the	most	suitable	platform	to	import	goods	into	china
let	us	get	to	know	about	chinese	cbec	market	cbec	market	was	established	since	in	form	of	sale	imported	goods	by	the	sellers	themselves	known	as	daigo	in	chinese	on	chinese	website	until	there	is	big	change	in	that	tmall	global	stepped	into	the	market	and	tremendous	change	in	that	the	number	of	imported	goods	in	cbec	market	was	started	to	gradually	increase
moreover	it	is	expected	that	in	the	value	of	cbec	imported	goods	will	be	half	of	the	value	of	all	imported	goods	from	china
apart	from	that	in	the	cbec	market	the	ratio	of	sales	through	the	platform	is	gradually	higher	than
this	is	because	the	chinese	government	seriously	opposes	daigo	and	chinese	consumers	are	afraid	of	frauds	and	thus	it	is	more	popular	for	consumers	to	purchase	goods	through	the	platform	which	guarantees	genuineness
what	are	the	components	of	chinese	cbec
how	do	they	share	the	market
for	the	first	quarter	of	alibaba	com	found	by	jack	ma	ruled	of	the	market	with	platforms	tmall	global	and	koala	com	followed	by	jd	worldwide	that	gets	for	vip	international	etc
as	the	chinese	market	is	gigantic	every	platform	will	have	its	own	targeted	consumers
for	example	koala	com	has	million	customers	that	are	active	users
it	targets	on	high	end	high	consuming	power	customers	that	desire	genuine	branded	goods	with	high	quality
targeted	customers	will	be	working	individuals	age	years	old
on	the	other	hand	red	an	abbreviation	of	little	red	book	or	xiaohongshu	is	social	platform	similar	to	instagram	and	is	equipped	with	function	that	imported	goods	on	sale	are	genuine
it	has	million	customers	that	are	active	users
it	targets	urban	women	in	which	is	gen	and	reside	in	big	cities	that	are	called	top	tier	cities
chinese	cbec	market	will	divide	customer	target	segment	according	to	different	tiers	such	as	super	st	tier	which	consists	of	cities	namely	beijing	shanghai	guangzhou	and	shenzhen
there	are	cities	under	new	tier	such	as	chengdu	hangzhou	wuhan	chongqing	nanjing	etc
cities	under	tier	such	as	xiamen	fuzhou	wuxi	kunming	harbin	etc
and	cities	under	tier	such	as	weifang	yangzhou	guilin	shanya	etc
in	which	each	group	is	different	in	tastes	of	demands	and	online	platforms
from	this	pimkwan	pointed	out	that	the	top	chinese	travelers	who	visit	thailand	for	holidays	mostly	come	from	super	st	tier	and	new	tier	what	should	be	sold	to	the	chinese	commerce	market
according	to	the	survey	from	consumer	groups	in	cbec	almost	thinks	that	goods	from	overseas	will	improve	their	standard	of	living	in	term	of	quality	goods
imported	goods	will	meet	their	demands	on	safety	hygiene	and	satisfaction
this	reflects	on	the	top	list	of	popular	imported	goods	on	cbec	which	are	none	other	than	cosmetics	personal	care	healthcare	products	and	supplements	as	well	as	mother	and	baby	products
all	these	products	have	to	be	directly	contacted	with	skin	consumed	into	the	body	and	have	direct	effect	on	health
product	quality	thus	comes	as	the	first	factor	that	brings	satisfaction	to	cbec	customers	followed	by	after	sales	services	and	payment	convenience	respectively
nowadays	china	is	mobile	first	country	and	more	than	of	chinese	consumers	make	payments	via	mobile	phones	through	several	platforms	which	are	wechat	pay	alipay	unionpay	jdpay	com	etc
chinese	social	media	an	irreplaceable	marketing	tool	social	media	is	an	important	tool	for	chinese	cbec	because	it	creates	visibility	and	reliability	of	products	in	the	eyes	of	chinese	consumers
however	do	not	forget	that	china	has	her	own	social	media	and	these	platforms	are	operated	in	the	chinese	language
nevertheless	pimkwan	scb	chinese	business	specialist	suggested	an	easy	formula	to	important	chinese	social	media	platforms
the	first	stands	for	baidu	search	engine	that	of	chinese	use	and	there	are	billion	searches	per	day
stands	for	alibaba	com	an	owner	of	weibo	which	is	chinese	version	of	twitter	and	youku	chinese	youtube	which	gathers	chinese	influencers	altogether
is	for	tencent	an	owner	of	wechat	which	is	popular	online	chat	platform	in	china	with	billion	user	accounts
last	but	not	the	least	the	last	for	bytedance	an	owner	of	the	short	video	platform	tiktok	which	has	billion	views	per	day
summary	of	the	secret	to	chinese	cbec	scb	has	summarised	ways	to	chinese	cbec	into	points	which	are	understand	the	market	and	target	group	to	decide	the	most	suitable	platform	strategy	cbec	is	platform	for	an	international	competition	that	one	will	have	to	compete	with	japanese	korean	american	branded	goods	chinese	cbec	consumers	are	looking	for	genuine	safe	and	good	quality	products	the	right	platform	to	present	identity	and	positive	rumors	on	an	online	platform	is	important	thus	the	budget	for	the	digital	market	must	be	ever	ready
the	chinese	consumer	market	right	now	can	be	compared	to	the	attractive	lady	that	is	desired	by	many	men	which	are	also	hard	to	win	her	heart	overdue	to	the	fast	changing	nature	of	consumers
however	careful	preparation	will	open	the	opportunity	for	the	products	to	make	their	way	into	the	heart	of	the	consumers	in	no	time
for	sme
ar	commerce	data	commerce	metaverse	may	sound	like	new	things	but	they	are	already	happening	in	commerce
even	without	covid	the	commerce	business	is	already	growing
covid	is	just	catalyst	for	more	consumers	to	shop	online	make	this	business	grow	faster
khun	mek	nithi	satjatipawan	managing	director	and	co	founder	commerce	warehouse	company	with	more	than	hundred	thousand	orders	per	month	shares	experiences	about	the	trends	in	commerce	business	including	the	key	to	how	to	make	commerce	business	to	be	able	to	compete	and	grow	continuously
the	commerce	market	in	asia	is	valued	at	trillion	baht	which	is	the	largest	market	larger	than	all	continents	combined
there	were	billion	commerce	shoppers	last	year	growing	more	than	with	the	largest	growth	in	southeast	asia
in	thailand	the	value	of	commerce	is	billion	baht	the	second	largest	after	indonesia
there	are	million	commerce	shoppers	in	thailand	and	it	growing
the	average	spending	amount	is	baht	person	year	which	is	considered	quite	lot	of	spending
and	interestingly	at	present	only	of	thais	have	access	to	the	internet	which	means	the	other	the	market	still	has	lot	of	potential	for	growth
the	covid	also	has	positive	effect	on	the	market	as	well
but	the	problem	is	that	although	the	opportunities	are	wide	the	chances	of	entrepreneurs	losing	are	also	high
because	these	problems	the	cost	is	getting	more	and	more	expensive
advertising	costs	are	more	expensive
in	addition	various	commerce	platforms	it	not	free	as	usual
all	big	companies	are	doing	business	on	commerce	in	thailand
the	three	giants	that	have	grown	commerce	in	thailand	but	at	the	same	time	also	dominate	the	thai	commerce	fortunes	alibaba	group	lazada	tencent	shopee	and	central	group	which	have	teamed	up	with	jd	com	resulting	in	massive	price	cuts
scramble	the	sales	area	it	harder	to	reach	customers	because	one	customer	buys	things	through	multiple	channels	including	lazada	shopee	facebook	and	instagram	making	it	more	and	more	difficult	to	please	customers
mek	said	there	are	many	uncertainties	that	can	cause	businesses	to	lose	quickly
the	cause	is	cell	phones	will	disappear	mobile	will	not	be	the	only	main	channel
the	second	reason	is	that	gen	millennials	will	rule	the	world	new	generation	who	is	very	tech	savvy	and	familiar	with	the	virtual	world
the	third	cause	is	the	time	bomb	years	years	years	year	which	is	business	that	changes	rapidly	within	years	born	and	dies	very	quickly
the	last	point	is	thai	people	are	less	competitive	because	thai	people	are	still	stuck	in	thailand
while	other	countries	expand	to	do	business	and	work	in	other	countries	more	such	as	singaporeans	vietnamese	people	who	move	to	work	abroad
therefore	if	thai	people	do	not	develop	it	will	be	difficult	to	fight	with	foreigners	in	which	four	fears	have	already	arisen	foreign	commerce	has	developed	long	way
being	in	our	home	is	lagging
before	long	we	must	use	modern	technology	such	as	robotic	warehouses	ar	commerce	or	drone	delivery
mek	emphasized	that	the	opportunity	was	only	frightening	as	well
we	are	living	in	tsunami	of	change
how	can	we	surf	this	change
when	we	can	fight	with	them	how	can	we	go	with	them	introduction	need	to	understand	customers	make	customers	love	and	remember	us
in	this	era	it	is	very	difficult	for	customers	to	remember	us
because	there	are	many	disturbances
therefore	having	to	go	back	to	do	customer	journey	must	understand	the	customer	how	to	do	so	that	he	can	bring	him	to	our	shop
the	customer	journey	in	online	shopping	marketing	funnel	consists	of	steps	awareness	do	lot	of	advertising	and	publicity
consideration	make	review	make	blog	use	kol	purchase	make	good	selling	channels	retention	give	privilege	advocacy	make	special	campaign	the	product	is	not	sold	on	its	own
whether	the	product	will	be	sold	or	not	depends	on	the	customer	whether	he	sees	that	the	product	meets	their	needs	or	not
advocacy	is	the	most	important	thing	for	online	sellers
that	is	there	must	be	people	to	buy	again	and	tell	others	to	buy
because	if	there	are	no	repeat	buyers	and	referrals	the	cost	of	acquiring	new	customers	is	more	and	more	expensive
therefore	what	you	need	to	do	from	the	start	of	your	business	is	to	make	people	remember	who	we	are	and	who	our	customers	are	what	shall	we	talk	about
good	start	from	day	one	will	allow	you	to	grow	well	and	don	need	ads
which	the	method	is	start	with	whyis	communication	to	make	us	understand	what	customers	want
naturally	people	tend	to	communicate	outside	in	meaning	only	what	and	how	but	the	right	thing	to	do	is	inside	out	starting	with	why	how	and	what
an	example	of	good	inside	out	communication	is	apple	which	is	believed	from	good	start
steve	jobs	always	said	everything	we	do	we	believe	in	challenging	the	status	quo	in	fact	what	apple	does	is	not	new	and	others	have	done	it	before	but	people	buy	because	people	believe	that	apple	modern	so	belief	is	important
we	always	make	decisions	based	on	our	emotions
if	the	mood	is	believed	to	be	yes	it	will	lead	to	decision
lead	to	purchase	while	the	numbers	the	reasons	weren	the	reasons	why	he	bought	it	was	just	supported
as	well	as	feeling	that	he	was	part	of	something	that	made	him	buy
who	is	the	community	of	people	who	use	that	brand
if	he	wants	to	be	part	of	that	society	he	must	have	that	product	the	sense	of	belonging
as	brand	we	need	to	light	up	our	beliefs
personaif	the	product	is	good	but	the	group	makes	mistake	we	also	make	mistake
we	must	tell	who	the	persona	of	our	customers	is	who	has	personality
how	to	make	persona	in	detail	will	help	us	to	visualize	the	customer	and	communicate	with	them	accurately
how	do	we	communicate
when	we	know	who	we	are	who	are	our	customers	we	will	figure	out	how	to	communicate	to	reach	them
good	communication	is	to	make	customers	feel	that	they	are	aware	of	the	properties	of	the	product	through	the	senses	form	taste	smell	sound	touch	which	is	what	people	use	in	making	purchase	decisions
it	can	be	done	online	using	photos	videos	and	good	photography
good	content	writing	can	make	people	perceive	all	five	senses
because	nowadays	there	is	technology	that	can	create	experiences	in	the	senses	perception
when	all	senses	are	complete	it	will	make	it	easier	for	people	to	make	purchasing	decisions
in	many	cases	creating	good	content	online	can	create	better	experience	than	going	to	the	real	thing
for	example	some	people	sell	the	same	products	such	as	bags	but	their	beliefs	are	different
for	example	the	first	brand	says	that	all	men	can	look	good	at	an	affordable	price
the	customer	group	is	women	who	buy	them	for	men	to	use	to	make	their	men	look	better
communication	is	bag	and	man	wears	suit	and	wearing	leather	shoes
but	another	brand	says	that	men	are	traces	is	the	pattern	the	more	you	experience	the	cooler
the	target	audience	will	be	sloppy	men	with	beard	dressed	like	man	and	buying	bags	for	their	own	use
communication	will	be	picture	of	man	wearing	jeans
bags	on	the	road	the	product	is	the	same	but	the	starting	point	is	different
the	customer	base	is	not	the	same	people	also	buy	with	different	expectations
khun	mek	continued	that	in	this	era	there	is	no	and	no	product	price	place	promotion	has	changed
today	people	buy	with	faith
today	is	customer	centric	to	understand	customers	as	deeply	as	possible
do	not	stick	to	the	product	to	be	attached	to	the	customer
we	must	know	what	customers	will	buy	to	solve	problems
if	we	stick	to	customers	we	will	be	able	to	find	new	products	to	meet	their	needs	that	change	with	the	times
growth	state	how	to	keep	growing	if	you	want	to	sell	more	you	need	to	expand	channels	because	the	customer	is	not	in	the	place	omni	channel	is	multi	channel	sales	strategy	with	unified	data
the	data	of	one	customer	must	be	continuous	regardless	of	the	channel	they	purchase	from
bring	the	item	as	close	to	the	customer	as	possible
each	channel	has	different	advantages
for	example	in	marketplace	like	lazada	shopee	is	used	to	build	good	awareness	and	is	used	to	find	new	customers
as	for	social	media	it	is	used	to	create	engagement	which	is	very	important	such	as	reviewing	blogging	and	social	media	to	make	people	see	and	believe	more
making	live	sale	of	the	experience	is	better	more	real	touches	make	people	believe	more
or	the	website	makes	old	customers	come	to	buy	again
or	build	good	relationship	through	line	giving	promotions	giving	special	privileges	each	channel	must	be	used	appropriately	because	each	channel	has	different	purpose
sales	agents	because	they	can	bring	our	products	to	new	customers	agents	can	create	their	own	sales	channels
using	sales	representative	can	help	us	sell	more	products	faster	because	it	will	help	us	reach	the	customers	we	can	reach
live	commerceselling	products	live	is	channel	that	is	more	and	more	worth	doing
there	is	still	lot	of	space	to	do
suitable	for	small	business	can	make	customers	buy	because	they	believe
the	current	sales	are	still	in	the	range	which	means	selling	inexpensive	products
but	in	the	future	expensive	products	will	do	more	life	which	is	now	done	abroad	such	as	chanel	showing	products	through	live	cross	borderthere	is	no	need	to	sell	only	in	thailand	anymore
but	must	know	the	preferences	of	each	country	which	is	different
for	example	swimsuit	shop	for	cup	is	woman	with	no	breasts	at	all
but	wearing	this	brand	of	swimwear	can	look	good
which	sells	very	well	in	japan	and	china
maturity	stage	when	it	can	start	to	sell	there	are	lot	of	channels	selling	well	but	if	not	looking	at	it	in	the	long	term	it	will	move	to	point	known	as	stalemate
it	like	there	ceiling	that	can	go	forward
during	this	period	to	be	able	to	grow	up	one	must	be	flexible	act	as	light	as	possible	to	adapt	faster
do	what	we	are	good	at	and	we	don	have	to	do	everything	by	ourselves	we	can	outsource	other	businesses	and	find	people	who	are	good	in	each	field	to	help	our	business
take	the	time	to	focus	on	the	customer
don	invest	long	term	but	invest	to	build	flexibility	for	yourself	making	it	flexible
we	don	know	what	will	happen	in	the	future	so	try	to	make	everything	more	variable	cost	rather	than	fix	cost
taking	things	lightly	such	as	outsourcing	order	fulfillment	that	turns	business	into	agile	is	modern	distributed	business	model	division	of	labor
problems	of	modern	shops	stores	that	need	to	manage	multiple	channels	and	many	promotions	at	the	same	time
managing	enough	stock	is	difficult
collecting	too	much	will	cause	money	to	sink	and	collecting	less	is	not	enough	to	sell
good	fulfillment	requires	flexibility
because	sales	are	up	and	down	for	example	during	sales	may	skyrocket
but	fewer	sales	on	weekdays	today	customers	want	to	feel	special	and	important	to	buy	again	and	spread	the	word
solution	order	management	system	connects	multiple	sales	channels	channel	together	the	system	pulls	orders	from	multiple	channels	automatically	the	shopkeeper	doesn	have	to	manage	the	back	of	the	shop	anymore
centralized	storage	service	and	optimization	as	well	as	providing	useful	data	you	can	see	when	each	product	will	run	out
warn	which	product	is	too	much	storage

the	advent	of	technology	creates	new	business	opportunities
food	delivery	is	watchful	business	with	intense	competition	every	day	and	get	is	the	latest	startup	to	challenge	the	huge	share	of	the	thai	food	delivery	market
in	the	course	of	the	nia	scb	international	business	enterprise	ibe	course	khun	korlap	suwatrangkun	chief	marketing	officer	of	get	came	to	talk	about	the	penetration	of	the	thai	market	of	new	startup	with	the	parent	company	gojek	from	indonesia
key	principles	for	doing	business	and	the	future	of	the	food	delivery	business	in	thailand
why	is	it	get
in	indonesia	gojek	comes	from	the	word	ojek	which	means	motorcycle	taxi
which	is	the	beginning	of	an	app	calling	motorcycle	hire	that	is	to	solve	the	user	pain	point
making	gojek	debut	as	unicorn	in	asean
and	when	gojek	expands	into	the	thai	market	with	the	hyper	localization	approach	it	is	believed	that	local	teams	make	the	best	decisions
thailand	team	led	by	khun	korlab	think	of	name	that	is	easy	to	understand	for	thai	people	and	able	to	continue	to	market	therefore	being	the	origin	of	get	brand
and	launching	the	first	service	get	win	and	get	delivery
before	expanding	the	service	get	food	and	get	pay
with	high	number	of	smartphones	and	internet	access	in	thailand	khun	korlab	therefore	saw	an	opportunity	to	expand	the	market	which	was	previously	almost	monopolized	by	the	big	players
khun	korlab	viewed	that	having	small	service	provider	here	the	user	doesn	have	much	choice
the	service	charge	previously	was	quite	high	due	to	lack	of	competition
the	advent	of	get	will	help	expand	the	market	with	the	local	insights	strategy
get	believes	that	we	can	make	difference	despite	coming	from	outside	startups	but	the	key	point	of	get	is	understanding	local	markets
but	it	takes	up	to	year	to	research	the	field	by	talking	to	the	motorcycle	to	understand	the	problem	and	coordinate	with	the	government	and	related	agencies	to	solve	the	problem	for	the	get	win	business	legally
and	when	it	comes	to	the	food	delivery	business	get	food	creates	business	model	that	helps	solve	pain	points	expensive	food	delivery	services	and	cheaper	prices
however	having	foundation	from	an	outside	start	up	has	become	strength	of	get	because	gojek	technology	has	created	special	service	in	thailand
for	example	shuffle	card	choose	to	display	food	banners	on	the	homepage	of	the	app	according	to	different	segments	such	as	time	morning	lunch	evening	location	distance	special	festivals	restaurants	that	are	partners	not	affiliated
etc
which	for	food	delivery	businesses	in	indonesia	and	thailand	is	similar	most	people	like	to	eat	street	food	however	the	use	of	foreign	technology	has	been	adapted	to	the	culture	of	the	local	country
attach	importance	to	partners	the	business	model	of	the	food	delivery	business	consists	of	main	pillars	merchant	driver	and	user
what	get	does	is	take	care	of	giving	importance	to	all	parties
there	are	concerns	that	the	arrival	of	get	will	make	street	food	stores	in	trouble
but	what	happened	is	to	help	merchants	connect	the	offline	world	and	online	together	and	expand	the	market
what	more	get	also	provides	useful	information	to	stores	such	as	users	who	order	lot	of	food	what	users	in	each	area	like	to	eat
etc
as	for	the	user	get	has	expanded	the	market	by	finding	new	business	model	that	caused	the	delivery	cost	to	decrease
from	the	previous	the	shipping	cost	is	high	because	the	user	pays	alone	then	change	to	shop	get	help	pay	some	of	the	shipping	fees
next	is	the	motorbike	driver
the	pillar	is	an	important	part	of	the	business	of	more	than	people
they	also	provide	other	benefits	such	as	family	insurance
opportunity	to	access	loans	loans	etc
importantly	get	drivers	can	withdraw	money	from	wallet	and	receive	money	without	having	to	wait	another	days	which	allows	motorcyclists	to	spin	the	money	more	fluently
finding	partnership	creating	strengths	another	key	thing	that	helps	get	operations	to	become	more	efficient
is	to	have	partnership	in	various	industries
for	example	scb	is	financial	partner	providing	payment	solution	services	for	mae	manee	restaurant	information	to	get	including	loans	for	motorcyclists
telecom	business	partners	also	help	support	stores	and	drivers
such	as	internet	packages	that	are	very	important	to	the	work	of	the	drivers
including	alliances	that	are	chain	restaurants	providing	alternatives	for	customers	in	addition	to	restaurants	of	small	entrepreneurs
the	future	of	startups	with	the	food	delivery	business	khun	korlab	believes	that	the	start	of	startups	with	the	food	delivery	business	will	change	the	market	overall	from	the	original	focus	on	capital	spending	to	attract	customers	to	grow	and	create	sustainability
by	creating	brand	value	by	using	technology	data	to	help	reduce	costs	increase	operational	efficiency	to	meet	the	needs	of	most	customers
in	expanding	the	market	get	executives	recommend	that	operators	must	look	fully	to	see	whether	the	cost	of	expanding	the	business	is	worth	the	return
there	are	many	forms	of	business	expansion	including	vertical	expansion	horizontal	expansion	and	market	expansion
finding	partners	to	help	us	expand	our	business	is	another	option
all	of	us	must	be	confident	that	this	is	strategy	that	truly	meets	our	business	needs

lao	pdr	is	one	of	the	clmv	countries	showing	relatively	high	economic	growth	of	over	more	than	on	average	five	years	before	the	covid	outbreak
in	december	the	nation	completed	chinese	backed	railway	project	under	the	belt	and	road	initiative	bri	which	is	expected	to	boost	its	economy	even	further	as	the	route	will	play	an	important	role	as	land	link	connecting	the	southeast	asian	economy	with	china	and	europe
despite	the	broad	effects	of	the	coronavirus	outbreak	the	lao	people	have	started	to	adapt	to	new	lifestyles	focusing	more	on	consuming	products	and	services	within	the	country	and	less	on	imports
this	trend	will	help	drive	production	in	the	agricultural	sector	and	demand	for	labor	in	many	sectors	increasing	household	incomes
demand	for	the	country	agricultural	products	is	expected	to	increase	in	foreign	markets
in	the	future	lao	pdr	has	set	goal	of	becoming	top	organic	agricultural	producer	and	exporter
the	main	agricultural	products	generating	income	for	lao	pdr	currently	are	rice	is	mainly	an	export	product	for	lao	pdr
in	the	economic	recession	caused	by	the	covid	pandemic	was	aggravated	by	natural	disasters	pushing	down	agricultural	productivity	especially	rice
production	was	insufficient	even	for	domestic	consumption	driving	the	price	of	domestic	production	higher	than	imported	rice
the	government	aimed	for	million	tons	of	rice	but	produced	only	million	tons	due	to	weather	conditions	plant	diseases	and	insects	destroying	crops
if	the	harvest	was	as	planned	lao	pdr	would	have	been	able	to	reduce	rice	imports	from	abroad	by	up	to	tons
under	an	agreement	laos	has	beengranted	an	annual	quota	for	tons	of	rice	and	cattle	and	buffaloes	for	export	to	china
to	be	more	self	reliant	this	year	the	government	has	encouraged	more	rice	farming	as	the	main	commodity	for	exports
durianwith	the	government	plan	to	export	durian	primarily	to	china	the	fruit	is	becoming	product	that	generates	income	for	the	country
lao	pdr	imports	durian	saplings	from	other	countries	and	primarily	grows	them	in	champasak	province	both	native	and	mon	thong	varieties
exports	are	expected	to	begin	in	chinese	investors	have	applied	to	the	government	for	land	concessions	of	approximately	rai	hectares	for	the	cultivation	of	durians
the	reason	for	the	increase	in	laotian	durian	exports	is	due	to	the	country	free	trade	agreements	ftas	which	allow	laos	to	enjoy	import	duty	exemption	from	countries	including	china	italy	new	zealand	japan	india	and	others
bananas	have	surpassed	rice	as	the	country	most	important	agricultural	export
according	to	data	from	the	ministry	of	industry	and	trade	the	value	of	banana	exports	to	foreign	countries	reached	usd	million	in	this	represents	percent	increase	over	the	previous	year	with	china	and	thailand	being	the	primary	customers
the	majority	of	producers	are	contract	farmers	but	the	government	has	suspended	land	concessions	and	terminated	contracts	with	large	number	of	companies	that	violated	rules
as	result	there	are	fewer	banana	farmers
the	government	believes	that	banana	cultivation	should	follow	good	agricultural	practices	gap	and	other	policies	to	promote	clean	environmentally	friendly	sustainable	agriculture
rubber	is	one	of	lao	pdr	economic	crops	generating	significant	revenue	with	plantations	occupying	approximately	thousand	hectares	in	the	province	of	luang	namtha
the	price	per	kilogram	is	kip	approximately	baht	while	cup	lump	is	sold	at	kip	kg	approximately	baht
despite	the	fact	that	the	selling	price	is	not	very	high	rubber	has	the	potential	to	generate	significant	amount	of	revenue	for	the	country	thereby	improving	living	conditions
as	result	the	government	encourages	rubber	planting	and	the	formation	of	rubber	associations	to	serve	as	learning	centers	for	rubber	cultivation	and	to	boost	bargaining	power
farming	patterns	in	laos	type	small	landowners	who	handle	their	own	work	and	investment	with	knowledge	obtained	from	informal	partners	from	china
type	farmer	organizations	which	are	rare	due	to	lack	of	management
type	contract	farming	with	foreign	investors
form	land	concessions	for	farming
according	to	statistics	around	of	farming	in	the	country	operates	under	types	and	this	presents	opportunities	for	thai	investors	to	enter	into	agricultural	business	in	laos	where	local	production	is	still	insufficient	for	domestic	consumption
the	country	still	needs	funding	mainly	for	improving	production	facilities	the	purchase	of	fertilizers	and	animal	feed	and	upgrading	technology	for	cultivation	and	the	processing	of	agricultural	products
it	is	therefore	good	opportunity	for	thai	entrepreneurs	to	export	agricultural	products	to	lao	pdr	and	to	invest	in	an	agricultural	industry	that	requires	knowledge	and	skills	while	sharing	modern	technology	to	help	increase	agricultural	productivity	so	that	the	nation	can	provide	enough	for	domestic	consumption	and	increase	export	value
it	is	also	an	opportunity	to	expand	the	market	for	agricultural	equipment
customers	interested	in	doing	business	in	lao	pdr	can	contact	the	siam	commercial	bank	vientiane	branch	which	is	ready	to	provide	any	services	they	need

that	means	great	commercial	opportunities	in	the	future	of	the	lao	pdr	especially	the	construction	of	the	china	laos	high	speed	train	project
china	high	speed	electric	railway	project	laos	pdr	has	linked	from	kunming	to	vientiane
and	will	connect	to	thailand	at	the	st	thai	laos	friendship	bridge	via	nong	khai	korat	province	pass	to	malaysia	and	the	destination	is	singapore
the	purpose	of	this	project	in	order	to	link	the	asian	european	and	north	african	economies	together
which	is	called	the	silk	road	economic	project	or	one	economic	zone	one	path	one	belt	one	road	obor
which	teased	the	silk	road	in	the	past
at	marco	polo	italian	merchants	and	explorers	traveled	to	china	to	buy	silk	to	sell	to	aristocratic	groups	in	europe	until	the	silk	road	became	important	trade	routes	between	asia	and	europe	the	silk	road	of	the	st	century	covers	countries	in	regions	namely	east	asia
southeast	asia	asia	middle	east	north	africa	south	asia	and	europe
divided	into	the	land	one	belt	and	sea	one	road
the	route	that	has	the	most	relationship	and	affects	thailand	is	the	kunming	vientiane	route
which	has	length	of	about	kilometers
it	is	part	of	the	railroad	that	connects	the	region	also	known	as	the	kunming	singapore	railway	with	total	distance	of	about	kilometers
the	aim	of	laos	pdr	with	the	construction	of	this	railway	for	the	economy	to	grow	in	leaps	and	bounds	with	about	kilometers	it	is	surrounded	by	important	economic	sources	as	follows	special	economic	zone	in	bo	tern	bo	han	luang	namtha	subdistrict	which	is	distribution	center	and	the	famous	entertainment	business	district	of	laos	and	close	to	xishuangbanna	civilization	which	is	currently	gaining	popularity	with	foreign	tourists	golden	triangle	special	economic	zone	bo	kaeo	province	there	is	project	nakorn	nakorn	as	comprehensive	business	center

thai	biz	lao	co
so	that	your	overseas	business	is	not	interrupted
scb	overseas	branch	network	is	ready	to	support	and	provide	services
looking	up	in	all	real	estate	bibles	location	is	the	achillean	point	whether	or	not	your	hostel	is	surviving	or	falling
all	along	your	left	and	right	of	the	bts	lines	every	building	been	sealed	with	sold	while	the	rest	unsolds	price	has	been	skyward	incredibly	high
however	when	there	is	will	there	must	be	way	super	premium	location	may	not	be	the	ultimate	truth
travelling	ignites	travellers	dreams	to	enclose	in	their	pockets
one	of	the	dreams	they	have	grabbed	home	is	to	transfer	residence	or	building	into	hostel	just	to	embrace	the	experience	of	extending	hospitality	to	foreign	guests
lets	imagine	of	million	foreigners	arriving	at	thai	airports	some	waiting	with	luggage	for	limosines	from	luxury	hotels	to	pick	them	up	others	marching	under	the	tour	leaders	flag	to	check	in	at	designated	hotels	according	to	the	tour	programme	yet	there	is	another	grand	group	with	big	backpack	ready	to	scatter	around	according	to	the	applications	for	their	advance	self	reservation	points
the	latter	group	has	long	been	with	thai	tourism	and	still	going	strong	in	long	future	run
hostelworld	top	line	of	all	hostel	agencies	worldwide	source	of	more	than	networks	has	stated	an	apparent	point	that	during	the	first	half	of	total	reservations	of	hostel	and	economy	accommodation	had	skyrocketed	to	million	transactions
the	increase	was	with	asian	accommodation	engagement	of	whereas	thailand	was	one	of	the	main	destinations	from	almost	systematic	hostels	in	provinces
koa	san	road	has	been	incapable	to	monopolize	backpackers	as	in	the	past	with	matter	of	fact	that	there	are	friendly	rate	accommodations	through	all	the	city	areas	from	sukumvit	silom	siam	square	etc	which	beckon	on	tourists	to	come	over
the	previous	hostel	fixed	formula	has	then	adjusted	to	an	open	location	as	much	as	opened	mind	of	new	trendy	tourists	who	likely	to	shake	off	their	tiredness	and	walk	bit	further	in	exchange	for	new	horizon	of	worthy	experiences
the	definition	of	best	hostel	locations	on	the	other	hand	are	far	different	from	the	stars	hotels	as	the	victorious	hostel	locations	deem	not	to	be	situated	just	in	the	heart	of	the	city
mass	transportation	plays	most	important	role	in	pricing	with	the	favour	of	the	shortest	walking	distance
however	hostels	situated	down	by	the	alleys	may	also	win	tourists	heart	with	the	closer	communities	nearby	enchanting	visitors	with	their	immaculated	environment
most	of	the	hostels	clients	have	sorted	after	and	been	granted	with	this	kind	of	spell	while	the	luxury	hotels	fail	to	offer
please	keep	in	mind	that	all	tourists	are	not	party	animals
some	are	peaceful	and	some	are	explorer
charming	hidden	place	at	the	end	of	the	alley	or	the	suburban	area	is	worth	steadfast	roaming	around	if	that	hostel	is	true	oasis	of	heart	and	soul
besides	location	is	not	always	the	factor	easily	to	promote	or	demote	the	hostels
the	primary	factor	genuienly	consists	of	maintaining	of	cleanliness	and	security	which	had	been	determinated	the	highest	review	scores	or	the	switch	off	of	rising	star	hostels	already	in	the	past
therefore	most	importantly	your	dreamed	hostel	must	not	situated	in	risky	areas
the	investment	on	security	system	to	protect	life	and	assets	the	separation	of	common	area	and	residential	area	keys	for	guests	only	big	lockers	with	entire	lock	system	all	of	these	modern	technology	will	sustain	trendy	hostels	in	centralizing	all	crossing	points	of	security	into	one	intelligent	key	which	comes	in	form	of	key	card	key	chain	or	wrist	band	to	please	the	new	generation	after	all
lastly	the	investment	in	the	owners	well	acquainted	area	is	an	advantage	in	order	to	feather	on	salable	highlight	points	of	the	area
narrative	story	of	the	local	nearby	such	as	the	signature	dishes	within	the	area	the	coffee	shop	not	to	be	missed	or	the	superb	neighborhood	museum	should	be	inserting	in
the	flourish	of	hostel	business	depends	on	these	mere	factors
no	need	to	rent	the	most	expensive	building	on	main	road	and	work	your	fingers	to	the	bone	just	to	return	the	capital	unknown	when	to	be	recovered
because	life	starts	at	home
scb	is	ready	to	help	you	reach	for	your	dream
marketers	know	so	well	that	consumers	who	look	for	reliable	product	tend	to	buy	brand	not	the	product	itself
creating	brand	is	strategy	to	create	business	identity	and	grow	sales
according	to	research	by	kadence	international	therere	marketing	trends	that	created	brands	in	line	with	the	new	normal
degree	wellness	consumers	change	their	perspectives	towards	wellness	or	optimal	health
that	means	to	shift	focus	from	good	health	and	physical	look	to	mental	health	more
in	other	words	optimal	health	is	holistic	approach	for	healthy	body	and	healthy	mind
that	trend	is	obviously	seen	in	the	city	where	there	is	pandemic	of	covid	like	wuhan
after	reopening	the	city	the	online	fitness	market	is	prevailing
also	therere	lots	of	articles	about	mental	care	for	people	who	have	to	stay	home
in	singapore	health	services	in	psychology	and	social	welfare	are	open	as	theyre	essential	for	people	during	period	of	anxiety
whatever	business	you	do	you	should	realize	how	your	products	or	services	have	positive	impact	on	physical	and	mental	health
it	reflects	that	your	brand	is	by	the	side	of	customers
even	though	the	pandemic	is	recovered	this	trend	will	still	remain
purposeful	design	over	the	years	the	heart	of	creating	brand	is	brand	purpose	or	to	show	customers	that	the	core	objective	of	the	business	is	not	to	grow	sales	but	to	be	part	that	creates	more	livable	society	such	as	reforestation	anti	racial	discrimination	or	environmental	protection
however	after	the	covid	crisis	consumers	view	that	brand	purpose	is	to	create	good	image	of	business	through	advertising	only	but	is	not	possible	to	help	society
marketers	have	to	change	the	strategy	to	purposeful	design	which	entrepreneurs	and	consumers	can	join	hands	to	make	the	world	better
for	example	louis	vuitton	adapted	this	trend	by	manufacturing	medical	devices	to	prevent	the	outbreak	of	covid
razer	singapore	company	that	sells	gaming	hardware	produced	face	masks	to	reduce	their	shortages
those	two	brands	truly	express	their	effort	to	support	society	and	this	inspires	consumers	that	theyre	able	to	be	part	of	helping	society	as	well
over	the	crisis	consumers	might	feel	left	out	and	hopeless	as	they	couldnt	help	themselves	and	family	to	get	away	from	that	uncertainty
creating	brand	with	purposeful	design	is	to	create	new	identities	for	consumers	with	courage	and	not	burden	to	society	while	cooperating	with	brand	to	nurture	society
connection	the	trend	as	mentioned	will	connect	consumers	to	be	part	of	the	brand
according	to	the	survey	by	washington	post	consumers	will	stay	single	longer	and	tend	to	live	alone	especially	in	big	cities
in	japan	will	represent	single	households	by	the	year	while	in	south	korea	in	single	households	will	reach
from	the	covid	crisis	to	the	new	normal	social	distancing	or	online	communication	make	most	people	lack	physical	interaction	which	is	the	basic	human	need
thats	why	most	people	expect	that	relationship	connection	will	be	more	effective	after	the	covid	crisis	is	over
for	brand	creation	proposition	of	marketers	is	to	create	connection	with	consumers	through	products	and	services	by	conducting	continued	conversation	to	check	their	needs	and	their	satisfaction	with	products	or	asking	customers	to	share	their	suggestions	in	developing	products	or	naming	new	products	so	theyll	have	sense	of	product	belonging
moreover	creating	group	chat	to	share	good	experiences	with	each	other	like	leisure	activities	or	favorite	shopping	places	is	another	way	to	build	small	community	that	can	connect	customer	groups	and	brands
thus	marketers	will	have	chance	to	study	more	marketing	trends	apart	from	values	or	the	preference	of	each	customer
personalization	it	means	creating	brand	to	accommodate	specific	individuals
for	example	many	businesses	use	location	or	health	data	from	smartphones	to	create	products	services	or	personalized	marketing	campaigns	for	consumers
besides	entrepreneurs	also	use	smart	home	technology	developed	by	ar	facial	recognition	application	to	design	homes	or	shops	to	tailor	each	customer	needs
with	todays	innovation	the	personalization	trend	enables	us	to	do	both	online	and	offline	flawlessly
as	result	marketers	can	define	consumer	needs	and	take	advantage	of	advanced	technology	to	develop	products	and	services	that	meet	individual	needs
entrepreneurs	and	marketers	must	always	ask	themselves	are	consumers	satisfied	with	products	or	services	in	order	to	keep	developing	products	and	services	including	marketing	plans
following	up	on	the	current	situation	is	always	must	because	the	uncertainty	has	an	impact	on	consumers	so	marketing	strategies	will	need	real	time	adjustments	to	cope	with	all	changes
for	sme
the	true	story	that	international	business	people	face	finding	reliable	business	partner	isn	easy
the	more	finding	new	partners	who	live	in	different	hemisphere	different	languages	different	cultures	are	becoming	increasingly	difficult
khun	jedsada	chindasook	chindasook	group	who	is	the	sanwa	faucet	manufacturers	will	share	his	experience	with	finding	new	partners
if	choosing	the	wrong	business	partner	unless	the	business	doesn	go	anywhere	may	also	be	crooked	or	cheated	as	well
we	will	both	waste	time	and	waste	business	opportunities
finding	the	right	business	partner	in	new	market	is	not	an	easy	task	like	indonesia	we	have	never	traded	with	them	before
therefore	we	must	start	marketing	from	one	count
is	that	since	starting	to	find	partner	that	will	help	us	bring	products	into	that	country	make	various	documents	to	pass	the	certification	distribute	products	to	create	brand	awareness
all	of	these	are	very	difficult
very	difficult	in	the	manner	that	how	do	we	find	that	person
that	is	our	partner
in	the	past	this	type	of	marketing	it	like	trial	and	error
we	must	go	to	friend	or	acquaintances	slowly	introduce	each	other	to	meet	this	person	or	not
not	sure	he	has	connection	or	not	he	has	network	to	sell	products
is	there	channel	to	sell	the	products	or	not
but	we	must	try	and	try	to	do	it	with	them	trading	and	later	did	not	get	the	money
khun	joe	jedsada	chindasook	chindasook	group	who	is	the	sanwa	faucet	manufacturers
which	in	addition	to	domestic	sales	also	exported	to	the	middle	east	and	our	neighboring	countries	such	as	myanmar	cambodia	laos	vietnam	and	most	recently	indonesia
khun	joe	told	us	about	the	difficulty	of	finding	partner	in	new	market
in	which	everything	takes	time	budget	and	risks	that	may	occur	if	there	is	no	information	of	each	pair	of	eyes	that	is	reliable	or	not
which	is	very	important	point	in	expanding	the	market	in	the	future
how	much	can	we	trust	people	in	trade	fair
khun	joe	described	the	trade	fair	which	is	creating	brand	awareness	creating	an	image	to	let	people	who	may	be	partners	know	that	we	have	company	in	this	industry	exist	in	the	market
which	may	be	way	to	find	new	partners	but	in	truth	going	to	trade	fairs	is	to	set	up	booth	which	will	be	approached	by	some	people	who	might	say	that	they	are	potential	interested	in	our	products	interested	in	selling	want	to	become	partner	or	even	requesting	to	be	an	exclusive	dealer
which	cannot	know	if	what	he	claims	is	true	or	not	he	has	real	potential	real	sales	real	money	or	not
if	getting	in	and	agreeing	to	do	business	with	the	one	who	is	not	the	real	one	will	waste	both	time	and	worse	maybe	cheated
because	there	is	no	guarantee	or	certification	from	trusted	organization	which	you	considered	very	important	must	be	hurt	for	while	khun	joe	added
easier	to	find	reliable	partners	how	good	would	it	be	when	having	the	first	and	only	platform	to	connect	thai	merchants	to	new	and	reliable	business	partners
and	has	been	certified	by	leading	banks	more	than	from	countries	around	the	world
new	doors	that	open	the	opportunity	to	find	trusted	partner
to	promote	the	invasion	of	foreign	markets	without	restriction	reduce	the	burden	of	traveling	expenses	overseas	can	contact	to	negotiate	the	purchase	order	to	close	the	sale	on	the	platform	don	waste	time	lost	money	to	send	people	to	work	trade	fair	can	do	business	matching	anywhere	anytime
scb	trade	clubwill	come	to	help	with	this	matter
in	providing	information	the	story	of	person	who	can	import	products	in	each	category	such	as	mine	is	faucet
suppose	we	put	the	hs	code	of	the	faucet	export
information	will	come	up	that	our	products	have	many	people	importing	into	that	country	who	buy	in	bulk	and	each	one	has	good	credit	or	not
the	bank	of	each	country	he	has	inspected
already	selected	and	certified	here	it	is	another	comfort	to	be	relief
increase	the	potential	in	resource	management	and	marketing	when	there	are	online	platforms	that	can	find	and	connect	with	certified	partners	that	have	the	potential	from	all	over	the	world
resulting	in	shorter	time	periods	and	greater	resource	savings	but	get	more	results
in	which	khun	joe	considered	the	importance	of	time	and	resources	management	as	an	important	matter
especially	with	family	business	that	doesn	have	lot	of	human	resources
especially	in	new	markets	or	in	high	risk	markets	to	take	the	time	to	go	out	into	the	new	market	is	quite	limited
in	simple	matter	we	are	going	to	go	around	the	world	in	years
there	is	no	way	but	if	we	have	good	information	like	the	trade	club	has	said	are	there	any	interesting	partners
and	then	can	help	us	import	products	or	distribute	products	and	then	able	to	receive	the	money	back	will	enable	us	to	do	it	instead	of	having	to	travel	on	your	own	use	the	scb	trade	club	data
deal	just	twice	may	close	the	sale
makes	everything	faster	easier	which	ultimately	results	in	increased	work	efficiency	and	marketing	business	matching	will	not	be	difficult	to	spend	time	with
trial	and	error	and	take	risks	longer
with	combination	of	leading	financial	institutions	around	the	world	that	help	select	and	certify	trusted	partners	with	good	credit

supply	chain	systems	in	the	agriculture	manufacturing	sector	trade	sector	and	tourism	sector	have	changed	due	to	the	change	in	technology
along	with	the	accelerator	like	covid	that	makes	the	behavior	of	consumers	or	end	users	changes
the	greater	the	multiplicative	change
in	this	article	we	will	look	at	the	changes	in	the	supply	chain	in	various	business	sectors	and	what	should	thailand	do	next	to	cope	with	this	change
major	industries	in	the	country	are	affected	and	there	has	been	change	in	the	supply	chain	the	hardware	group	that	produces	electronic	devices
disrupted	by	modern	technologies	such	as	ai	causing	the	software	to	be	inserted	into	various	devices	and	become	smart	device
these	industries	will	compete	with	cost	leadership	that	is	on	price
whether	it	competing	with	china	taiwan	malaysia	or	new	competitor	like	vietnam
when	faced	with	an	economic	recession	as	well	as	facing	new	technologies	that	come	in
these	industries	have	dropped	by	around	but	at	the	same	time	there	is	surprising	amount	of	growth
because	there	is	covid	is	catalyst	it	is	digital	service	that	has	growth	picture	of	more	than
growth	is	in	line	with	the	situation	of	covid
this	causes	the	behavior	of	consumers	to	change	to	use	more	digital	services
there	are	lot	of	transactions	that	go	through	the	payment	gateway	system
another	industry	that	has	made	huge	leap	in	transformation	is	digital	content	which	is	mixture	of	the	supply	chains
whether	using	content	through	the	digital	world	or	social	media	creating	content	for	industries	severely	impacted	by	covid	such	as	tourism
to	create	new	dimension	in	the	supply	chain	in	the	tourism	business	digital	content	has	grown	approximately
new	wave	industry	group	known	as	data	analytics	service	with	growth	value	of	billion	baht	is	component	that	sees	change	in	the	supply	chain
digital	services	are	disrupting	agriculture	manufacturing	trade	and	tourism
these	are	the	changes	in	the	supply	chain	change	that	the	business	sector	must	adapt	to
not	only	from	within	the	country	but	also	from	outside	the	country
both	the	change	in	technology	and	the	change	in	consumers	caused	by	covid	and	the	emergence	of	new	players	looking	for	new	solutions	thai	entrepreneurs	must	think	about	three	issues
how	to	make	every	supply	chain	work	together	efficiently	and	working	can	lead	to	cost	leadership
because	the	industrial	sector	the	manufacturing	sector	the	agricultural	sector	has	reached	the	point	where	it	must	find	ways	to	reduce	costs	to	meet	the	new	lifestyle
differentiation	supply	chain	you	must	ask	yourself	what	to	do	to	offer	something	different	to	best	meet	the	needs	of	consumers
the	speed	of	the	supply	chain	must	be	faster
because	if	it	slow	it	won	catch	up	with	newcomers	or	the	competition	of	new	players
entering	the	economy	the	three	issues	mentioned	above	are	not	enough
still	must	look	at	what	will	come	as	product	or	service	that	will	be	the	champion	of	thailand
that	will	lead	to	these	supply	chains
this	is	the	change	of	supply	chain	and	doing	business	in	the	future
examples	of	changes	in	supply	chains	in	various	industries	agriculture	sector	in	the	past	farmers	planted	crops	and	sent	middlemen
from	the	middleman	sent	through	the	warehouse	and	then	into	the	mall
or	through	middlemen	and	go	to	the	fresh	market
but	changing	digital	tools	and	consumer	behavior	has	resulted	in	the	cutting	of	the	midstream	supply	chain
upstream	farmers	find	ways	to	deliver	products	directly	to	consumers	and	become	more	profitable
technology	has	come	to	help	these	things	change
is	that	farmers	can	sell	products	directly	to	consumers	and	consumers	can	buy	directly	from	farmers	by	using	social	commerce	in	trading
which	now	has	number	in	the	hundreds	of	millions	of	baht
this	is	supply	chain	that	has	changed	to	survive
caused	by	changing	consumer	behavior	technology	changes	that	are	more	accessible
supply	chain	manufacturing	industry	in	the	past	produced	and	then	entered	the	warehouse	and	from	the	logistics	that	are	distributed	through	direct	channels	that	is	retail	or	through	wholesale	then	go	to	retail	and	then	to	the	consumer
these	things	are	disrupted	like	agriculture
that	is	the	industrial	sector	can	become	an	upstream	that	sells	products	directly	to	consumers
not	just	domestic	consumers	but	able	to	export	abroad	with	new	supply	chains
this	looks	like	thailand	is	not	ready	but	there	are	important	players
coming	in	from	overseas	whether	lazada	shopee	or	jd	central	these	businesses	are	seeing	steady	increase	in	value	in	line	with	higher	industry	numbers	and	growing	confidence	in	the	digital	industry	index
therefore	both	the	warehouse	and	the	wholesale	must	adjust	because	the	former	distribution	channel	has	disappeared

including	exports	there	has	been	change	which	is	the	supply	chain	in	the	manufacturing	industry	from	production	to	trading	through	the	retail	system	and	to	the	consumer	that	has	been	shortened

consumer	stores	must	be	adjusted	in	accordance	with	different	accelerator	factors
as	for	the	tourism	sector	many	establishments	must	slow	down	or	temporarily	close	to	reducing	costs	to	survive
both	commerce	and	tourism	have	adopted	the	platform	to	change	their	supply	chain
whether	it	is	travel	business	that	has	made	digital	content	as	an	add	on	content	production	has	grown	lot
people	working	in	digital	content	have	also	grown	from	ten	thousand	to	thousand
this	means	that	these	people	are	working	to	support	the	supply	chain	of	the	travel	service	business	or	continuation	business
by	using	content	to	create	cravings	such	as	using	vr	or	virtual	reality	to	create	travel	cravings
like	traveling	in	real	place	you	can	buy	products	as	well	but	through	the	digital	world	itself
when	the	world	opens	again	it	can	draw	people	to	travel	in	the	real	world
the	tourism	business	when	faced	with	these	disruptions	must	adjust	itself
because	the	same	tourism	that	people	who	book	tickets	at	all	may	not	be
but	people	will	travel	in	the	digital	world	first	when	they	are	ready	then	go	on	real	trip
as	for	the	retail	or	trade	businesses	that	used	to	be	the	physical	world	they	will	be	gradually	reduced	in	size
until	becoming	digital	to	complement
sharing	economy	will	grow	such	as	cloud	kitchen	which	allows	restaurant	businesses	to	reduce	their	stock	of	raw	materials
therefore	the	supply	chain	in	all	businesses	has	changed
it	is	change	in	the	economic	structure	at	the	bottom	of	the	pyramid	with	changes	that	have	higher	value	added
in	the	future	if	thailand	allows	only	the	big	players	to	be	foreign	and	we	will	lose	the	balance	of	payments	in	technology

startup	is	another	popular	word	in	this	era
especially	among	the	younger	generation	that	everyone	would	like	to	be	startup
because	it	sounds	cool	reflecting	new	generation	who	loves	challenges	creative	and	ready	to	grow	rapidly
but	even	though	it	is	word	that	many	people	are	familiar	with	there	are	still	many	questions	about	startups	that	people	want	to	know	or	want	to	understand	more	clearly
initially	many	people	are	still	confused	about	how	startup	is	spelled
stick	together	or	separately
it	can	be	spelled	in	two	ways	adjoining	startup	and	start	up	written	separately	must	have	dashes
which	type	of	spell	will	be	chosen	choose	according	to	the	convenience	let	start	with	understanding	the	startup	with	questions	that	people	want	to	know
what	is	startup
startups	that	are	often	heard	do	you	know	what	startup	is
in	fact	there	are	many	versions	of	the	definition	of	the	startup
but	overall	startups	are	new	business	entrepreneur	and	focusing	on	rapid	growth
by	responding	to	consumer	demand	or	market	demand	by	offering	new	production	or	new	service	process	which	is	known	as	innovation
startups	are	like	small	company
that	may	have	single	owner	or	do	business	in	partnership	that	is	designed	to	grow	fast	and	can	be	reduced	or	expanded	easily
mostly	we	are	familiar	with	startups	that	offer	products	or	services	that	use	technology
that	is	because	most	startups	focus	on	new	technology	development
to	meet	the	needs	of	the	market
especially	the	use	of	technology	in	various	areas	such	as	the	internet	commerce	or	robotics	to	make	products	or	services	more	responsive	to	modern	consumers
the	process	will	focus	on	research	design	experimentation	and	verification	that	the	innovation	or	hypothesis	can	be	used	when	did	the	startup	occur
who	is	the	first	generation	of	startups
in	fact	startups	have	been	around	for	long	time	such	as	the	british	east	india	company	which	could	be	called	the	pre	startup
but	to	talk	about	the	beginning	of	today	startups	there	is	often	link	to	silicon	valley	in	california
which	is	currently	the	center	of	the	tech	company
examples	of	early	startups	such	as	international	business	machines	better	known	as	ibm	founded	in	but	if	talking	about	the	new	version	of	the	startup	that	we	are	familiar	with	today	are	formed	in	the	late
in	an	age	known	as	the	dot	com	boom	that	people	believe	that	technology	and	the	internet	can	change	the	world
the	companies	that	formed	at	that	time	such	as	amazon	netscape	or	google	itself	founded	in
when	to	stop	as	startup	change	to	enterprise	in	truth	this	question	is	difficult	to	answer	because	there	are	no	fixed	rules
for	example	some	startups	may	take	years	to	switch	to	the	enterprise
while	some	places	take	years
which	may	be	measured	by	net	income	profit	the	number	of	employees	that	reach	certain	point
one	person	had	set	criteria	for	determining	whether	that	startup	too	big	to	be	called	start	up	or	not	using	the	rule
the	criteria	were	created	by	alex	wilhelm
if	any	start	up	has	number	exceeds	certain	number	it	is	considered	too	big	to	be	called	start	up
how	are	startups	different	from	smes
both	startups	and	smes	are	similar	in	the	sense	of	being	small	organization	having	low	turnover	and	small	number	of	employees
however	both	are	clearly	different	as	well
by	dividing	the	differences	into	corners	namely	intent	startups	are	intended	to	grow	into	large	organizations
want	to	make	change	in	the	old	business	industry	disruptive
lead	to	new	products	or	service	processes	until	reaching	the	creation	of	new	markets
while	sme	wants	to	be	the	owner	of	their	own	business	have	stable	income	in	your	own	market	local	market	function	the	organizational	structure	of	startup	is	focused	on	repeatable	model	structure
can	be	enlarged	or	reduced
by	using	the	research	process	hypothesis	testing	and	evaluation
that	means	that	the	startup	maybe	successful	as	large	organization	if	the	assumptions	set	are	correct
but	if	the	hypothesis	and	the	experiment	are	wrong	it	may	be	abandoned	and	must	start	to	find	new	opportunities	or	hypotheses
while	sme	has	an	organizational	structure	that	focuses	on	delivering	value	to	its	customers
therefore	the	sme	organization	structure	does	not	need	to	change	frequently	or	must	change	quickly
funding	for	startups	in	order	to	be	able	to	grow	into	large	organization	that	can	create	change	for	the	industry
must	have	raised	funds	find	joint	investors	both	for	profit	sharing	and	finding	investors	to	invest	in	the	project
while	sme	business	owners	will	run	their	own	business	find	their	own	funds	which	may	be	private	capital	or	bank	loans	how	to	start	up	financing
there	are	main	ways	to	find	funds	bootstrappingor	using	your	own	funds	it	the	right	way	to	start	business	that	doesn	have	any	results	or	outcome	to	show	to	investors
crowdfundingis	another	method	that	is	popular	and	suitable	for	startups	that	are	famous	whose	work	can	be	clearly	shown
the	owner	of	the	startup	must	provide	details	of	the	business
business	goals	plan	to	generate	profit	and	the	amount	of	capital	needed	as	well	as	reasons	to	show	on	the	crowdfunding	platform
when	people	are	interested	in	ideas	and	plans	they	can	provide	funds	which	may	be	in	the	form	of	paying	for	goods	or	services	in	advance
or	may	give	in	the	form	of	donations
which	provides	an	opportunity	for	everyone	who	is	interested	and	believes	in	the	idea	of	that	startup	able	to	contribute	funds
angel	investmentis	to	find	investors	who	are	interested	and	have	expertise	in	investing	in	startups
usually	proposals	are	often	requested	and	checked	before	investing
in	addition	investors	may	be	able	to	provide	advice	or	be	mentors	for	startups
investors	have	contributed	lot	to	helping	prominent	and	potential	startups	like	google	or	yahoo	in	the	past
this	type	of	investment	usually	occurs	during	the	initial	stages	of	growth
in	which	investors	expect	profits	of	up	to	from	their	investments	and	tend	to	prefer	high	risk	investments	for	high	returns	as	well
venture	capital	vc	is	finance	manager	and	professional	investor	who	invests	in	high	potential	outstanding	startups
this	group	of	investors	is	often	out	of	investment	when	the	start	up	grows	into	the	stock	market	or	bought	from	other	investors
in	addition	to	providing	funding	vcs	also	provide	advice	and	assessments	in	terms	of	sustainability	and	scalability	as	well
from	the	questions	it	should	be	clearer	what	the	startup	is	and	what	is	the	starting	point
including	what	kind	of	business	ideas
being	startup	may	sound	modern	and	cool
is	new	generation	that	has	creativity	and	big	dreams
but	not	every	individual	will	succeed	because	the	study	found	that	of	startups	do	not	reach	the	shore
but	if	you	are	deciding	to	be	startup	don	let	this	number	push	you	backward
because	you	may	be	one	of	the	successful

but	divana	still	barely	stood	because	of	the	poison	of	covid	although	the	thought	that	preparation	has	always	been	this	crisis	is	more	serious	than	all	the	crises	that	have	been	past
we	began	to	know	that	china	has	an	impact	still	think	that	it	can	be	controlled	in	china	because	the	chinese	customer	base	is	around	only
thought	that	he	was	prepared	because	we	did	not	know	how	the	disease	spread
hong	kong	taiwanese	and	korean	people	were	infected	but	we	still	could	stay	because	we	have	expanded	our	customer	base	to	thai	people
after	while	the	government	ordered	to	close
close	the	restaurant	first
then	we	changed	the	restaurant	to	delivery
later	closed	all	clinics
it	is	good	that	we	do	vitamin	supplements	then	started	selling	vitamins
next	close	the	spa
all	are	closed
even	thai	people	still	cannot	use	the	service
was	surprised	that	it	was	big	issue
khun	tee	tells	the	beginning	of	new	major	crisis	that	is	currently	facing
although	divana	started	with	crisis	they	were	layoffs	from	the	airline
and	during	the	twenty	years	of	doing	business	there	have	been	many	crises	including	sars	avian	influenza	floods	or	politics
but	both	can	still	bring	the	divana	family	through	the	windy	waves	every	time
but	this	time	it	was	special	because	of	the	longitudinal	effects	that	had	never	been	experienced	before
the	more	difficult	the	more	you	get
the	crisis	is	lesson	that	must	be	passed	we	remind	ourselves	that	every	time	there	is	crisis	of	course	it	is	difficult
the	important	thing	is	our	mind	or	attitude
we	believe	that	this	crisis	will	be	lesson	we	must	go	through
have	word	of	encouragement	the	more	difficult	it	is	the	more	you	get	teachings	of	somdej	phra	wanrat
which	made	them	always	look	at	the	positive	side	that	ultimately	when	gritting	through	hardships	will	receive	good	things	is	reward	of	patience
from	what	it	used	to	be	preparations	used	to	take	months	and	months	but	now	the	institution	is	unpredictable
don	know	if	it	good	or	bad	today
therefore	must	adapt	every	day	every	time	according	to	government	policy
the	challenge	is	difficult	but	deep	inside	still	having	fun	with	management	matters
we	think	that	we	are	fortunate	that	we	have	chance	to	manage	in	the	most	difficult	time	in	our	lives
both	of	them	must	pass	through	not	only	the	body	but	the	heart
and	not	just	passing	but	having	to	pass	well
the	important	thing	is	that	we	try	to	keep	people	as	long	as	possible	and	still	take	good	care	of	them
as	much	as	physical	strength	and	encouragement	we	have
it	shows	the	importance	of	caring	for	employees	which	is	considered	divana	family	to	the	fullest
to	survive	must	adjust	strategy	khun	tong	told	us	about	the	strategy	to	survive	that	the	first	thing	is	to	reduce	costs
had	to	talk	to	the	landlord	to	ask	to	reduce	the	rent
when	there	is	no	income	must	do	anything	at	the	lowest	cost
and	staff	salaries	because	both	parts	are	fix	costs
and	how	to	set	up	system	for	employees	to	look	after	them	if	possible	and	stay	together	safely	to	the	end	of	the	crisis
the	second	part	is	earning	money
the	only	main	way	left	is	online
which	must	adjust	all	the	models	whether	it	is	for	cafes	food	selling	products	that	can	be	done	online	or	even	the	clinic
which	requires	rapid	adjustment	and	adjustment	it	not	just	channel	or	way	for	us	to	go	it	starts	with	the	mindset	of	every	employee
because	originally	divana	employees	are	mainly	skilled	in	service	work
when	had	to	change	online	the	mindset	must	be	rearranged	as	this	is	the	only	way	that	this	ship	will	survive	the	giant	wave	like	covid
must	learn	how	to	have	way	to	bring	divan	identity	online	and	reach	customers	fully	and	perfectly	during	the	intense	competition	as	it	is	the	only	way	in	the	real	world
it	is	very	serious	and	challenge	for	us
but	one	thing	that	we	think	all	the	time	is	that	the	more	difficult	it	is	the	more	you	get	and	every	crisis	has	chance
we	believe	that	if	the	covid	incident	has	passed	we	will	be	much	better	in	the	online	world	and	we	will	be	able	to	combine	both	online	and	offline	together	to	fulfill	the	customer	needs	perfectly	khun	tong	tells	us	about	business	strategies	adjustment	and	is	confident	that	devoting	all	the	power	available	will	enable	divana	to	reach	his	desired	goals
see	true	friends	through	the	crisis	unable	to	collect	the	debt	no	income	everything	was	blocked	but	money	still	has	to	flow	out
but	what	we	are	lucky	is	that	we	have	good	friend	who	is	siam	commercial	bank	khun	tee	continues	with	the	gratitude	received	from	true	friend
what	we	have	received	is	lot
the	scb	rm	team	came	in	to	take	care	even	though	we	have	not	yet	to	say	that	we	were	experiencing	problems
scb	rm	offered	with	low	interest	loans
by	telling	khun	tee	that	you	take	it	first	in	case	you	need	it
talked	for	about	week	then	transfer	money
then	told	him	that	he	was	trying	to	make	another	loan	which	was	issued	by	the	bank	of	thailand	which	is	loan	that	does	not	have	to	pay	interest	for	months
which	the	scb	considers	that	divana	should	be	qualified	because	the	bookkeeping	is	correct	in	accordance	with	the	revenue	department	rules
which	also	occurred	from	the	consultation	from	scb	as	well
we	have	good	coach
when	we	changed	our	accounting	system	we	knew	that	the	cost	was	great
management	fees	accounting	or	taxes	are	lot
but	today	we	know	that	when	we	do	something	right	when	someone	comes	to	help	us	it	easy
khun	tee	shares	the	good	fortune	of	following	scb	advice	on	how	to	adjust	your	accounting	system
we	are	glad	that	the	bank	taught	us	to	be	good	people
when	we	are	good	people	we	got	help
it	good	feeling	when	we	have	crisis	or	difficult	time
then	we	were	cheered	it	not	just	about	money
khun	tee	talked	about	the	encouragement	from	scb	as	both	partner	and	good	coach
although	tee	and	khun	tong	have	already	prepared	some	money	for	this	crisis	when	the	situation	of	covid	is	quite	long	and	endless	getting	this	lump	sum	helps	to	make	both	work	easier
khun	tee	and	khun	tong	view	that	the	scb	team	is	like	brothers	and	sisters	who	send	encouragement	through	various	resources	not	only	in	terms	of	financial	resources	but	also	helps	to	promote	the	products	through	various	channels	as	well
which	causes	the	top	up	amount	to	come	in
this	even	today	does	not	think	about	profit	just	think	about	how	to	make	the	employees	have	money	to	spend	until	the	day	of	the	situation	improves	and	the	business	began	to	return	to	the	same	or	better	in	the	future
we	will	stick	to	do	good	things
honesty	and	governance	to	set	an	example	for	the	new	generation	of	smes	that	when	you	do	good	there	will	be	lot	of	people	to	help	you	said	khun	tee	with	smile	even	when	facing	major	crisis
soft	loan	extends	the	sme	sbreath	this	crisis	has	been	helped	by	scb	very	quickly
soft	loan	we	got	quickly	and	in	time	with	the	incident
one	important	reason	is	that	we	have	been	looked	after	by	scb	before	the	incident
fortunately	we	have	professionals
as	consultant	came	to	help	take	care	and	plan	the	backyard	system	for	us	from	the	beginning
whether	it	is	financial	matters	payroll	issues	and	other	matters
once	the	incident	occurred	everything	seemed	to	be	already	being	prepared
khun	tong	told	us	about	the	good	advice	and	the	full	assistance	from	scb	which	makes	the	smooth	loan	application	smooth	and	fast
this	crisis	makes	khun	tong	become	clearer	that	cash	flow	is	the	breath	of	an	indispensable	sme
and	although	the	business	is	good	if	at	one	point	lacking	in	liquidity	can	make	business	collapse
fortunately	scb	helped	prepare	the	divana	from	the	beginning	in	terms	of	documentation	preparation
because	once	the	measure	is	approved	it	will	be	able	to	get	the	soft	loan	as	soon	as	possible	actually	lot	of	documents	both	from	scb	and	those	of	the	bank	of	thailand
but	with	trust	and	good	partner	rm	is	always	there	bringing	all	the	documents	to	sign	at	home
what	happened	was	that	when	the	measure	came	out	at	the	beginning	of	the	month	in	less	than	month	everything	was	very	neat
just	in	time	we	had	to	pay	the	employees	salaries
tee	talked	about	the	full	help	from	scb	in	helping	to	get	the	soft	loan	from	bank	of	thailand	in	time
which	is	loan	that	does	not	pay	interest	for	months	years	later	to	pay	only	low	interest	which	is	almost	grant	that	helps	both	to	lead	the	company	through	the	crisis	and	can	also	look	after	the	employees	to	continue	to	have	income	we	will	bring	everyone	back	to	work
we	will	be	committed	to	creating	jobs	and	income	for	the	thai	people
because	having	work	is	the	value	of	people	we	will	adhere	to	this	we	will	make	the	most	use	of	the	resources	we	have	acquired
build	sustainability	try	to	make	this	as	useful	and	sustainable	as	possible	said	khun	tong
the	lesson	learned	from	covid	is	not	to	be	careless	about	life
always	be	mindful	have	good	attitude	ready	to	adapt	to	events	that	will	occur	all	the	time
and	the	important	thing	is	to	have	friends	or	have	good	business	partners	ready	to	be	side	by	side	whether	it	is	prosperous	day	or	in	difficult	times
let	scb	sme	be	friend	to	walk	by	your	side
support	your	business	to	grow	and	overcome	the	crisis
because	we	believe	in	the	potential	of	thai	smes
smes	interested	in	applying	for	soft	loan	can	contact	your	relationship	manager	or	call	the	call	center	at	for	sme	new	digital	banking	platform	for	enhancing	the	good	financial	experience	for	business	customers
any	business	can	be	successful	such	as	the	hotel	business
in	addition	to	creating	beautiful	distinctive	hotel	with	selling	point	providing	excellent	service	experience	for	customers
but	that	not	enough
having	consistent	number	of	people	reserving	rooms	is	what	every	hotel	need
in	the	age	that	social	media	is	consumer	universe	online	marketing	with	content	marketing	to	attract	and	reach	target	customers	is	something	that	hotel	operators	must	learn
the	dots	hotel	game	changer	has	brought	content	marketing	experts	to	share	their	experiences	with	participants	that	can	do
we	have	khun	kasemsak	sirirak	managing	directo	movf	media	group	co	ltd	the	owner	facebook	page	the	sneak	out	with	over	million	followers	khun	nathira	wongpaitoon	co	founder	graft	co	ltd	content	maker	travel	and	design	enthusiast	and	khun	amornpun	somsawat	director	hotel	industry	expert	siam	commercial	bank	who	is	consultant	for	over	years
they	came	to	share	tips	for	creating	interesting	content
using	passion	to	create	content	how	should	begin	page	via	social	media	begin
every	guru	thinks	that	the	beginning	should	be	based	on	existing	preferences
making	content	based	on	love	and	liking	will	prevent	you	from	having	to	force	yourself
have	enough	knowledge	base	then	can	do	it	for	long	time
the	important	thing	is	to	be	different	from	what	other	people	are	doing
and	sharing	experiences	through	fun	storytelling	will	make	your	page	creation	successful
this	is	no	different	from	creating	hotel	page
there	must	be	character
find	yourself	clearly	what	the	hotel	looks	like
communicate	with	any	customer	groups	and	create	content	based	on	what	people	are	searching	for	so	the	page	will	be	followed
know	them	know	us	to	release	content	any	time	it	gets	hit	there	are	principles	of	content	creation
first	there	must	be	clear	goal	of	what	kind	of	content	to	do	what	to	do
the	second	must	know	who	the	target	audience	is
third	present	content	from	pain	points	or	what	the	target	audience	is	looking	for	importantly	the	goal	must	be	clear
viral	creation	is	not	coincidence	to	make	content	so	viral	that	you	need	to	learn	what	people	want	to	see
must	use	radar	to	find	out	what	people	are	interested	in	at	that	time
if	social	monitoring	is	used	it	will	help	to	understand	the	current	trend
another	thing	that	should	not	be	overlooked	when	people	will	share	content	because	of	value	and	must	know	that	one	piece	of	content	doesn	just	speak	to	the	world	but	to	our	target	audience
khun	nathira	wongpaitoon	co	founder	graft	co	ltd	sees	that	making	content	bang	sometimes	has	to	test	and	see	the	trend	of	what	people	like
see	insight	for	what	people	want	to	know	about	is	the	opportunity	to	be	viral
khun	amornpun	somsawat	director	hotel	industry	expert	siam	commercial	bank	views	the	creation	of	content	for	the	hotel	business	as	give	an	example	resort	style	hotels
when	it	comes	to	viral	it	is	necessary	to	see	if	it	fits	the	character	of	the	hotel
no	need	to	follow	every	trend	must	always	remember	what	the	goal	of	communication	is	who	are	the	customers
does	the	client	want	to	listen
if	not	truly	knowing	customers	the	content	communicated	will	not	reflect	our	brand
promote	places	that	no	one	knows
what	to	do
making	destination	content	in	places	that	people	don	know	aside	from	having	to	take	beautiful	attractive	images	still	must	present	with	new	ideas
what	are	some	ways	to	motivate	people	to	travel	along
khun	kasemsak	the	owner	page	sneak	out	sees	that	content	creators	must	respond	to	how	good	the	place	is	must	know	deeply	know	truth	understand	that	area	more	than	ordinary	people	and	find	out	the	strengths	of	the	place	and	what	advantages	there	are	why	people	have	to	go	and	why	it	is	different	from	other	places
including	the	proposed	format	must	satisfy	the	consumers	and	that	is	indispensable	to	give	any	experience	to	those	who	go
in	addition	before	producing	content	try	to	sell	that	location	offline	first
by	finding	the	common	characteristics	of	the	target	customer	persona	and	try	to	sell
if	unable	to	sell	then	change	to	new	persona	so	you	don	have	to	waste	time	and	money
if	you	can	sell	offline	don	go	online
must	come	back	and	update	the	content
this	is	simple	way	to	check	if	the	content	has	been	targeted
hook	the	perfect	punch	to	increase	sales	from	destination	content	creating	hotel	page	or	hotel	website	aside	from	having	basic	hotel	information
creating	destination	content	will	help	the	tie	in	increase	sales	for	the	hotel
by	having	to	find	the	journey	of	the	customers	why	do	customers	choose	the	hotel
what	are	the	locations	near	the	hotel
then	put	in	content	to	find	out	what	content	makes	customers	decide	to	stay	at	the	hotel
then	add	that	type	of	content	to	add	such	as	the	strengths	of	hotels	that	make	people	stay	attractions	around	the	hotel	etc
how	to	choose	content	to	fit	with	the	platform	there	are	many	social	media	platforms
how	to	choose	the	right	content	for	each	platform
khun	kasemsak	from	sneak	out	shared	that	must	learn	the	behavior	of	people	in	each	platform	and	make	it	appropriate	such	as	youtube	offering	videos	facebook	focuses	on	providing	data	in	many	formats
while	instagram	emphasizes	beautiful	images	to	inspire
in	addition	does	the	content	created	to	add	value	to	the	target	audience
therefore	the	selection	of	content	must	be	thought	of	as	process	in	order	to	make	the	content	suitable	for	creating	and	responding	to	the	purpose	of	communication
how	to	create	content	for	continue	when	creating	hotel	page	or	website	and	want	to	have	followers	and	engagement	what	should	the	hotel	do
first	there	must	be	an	ongoing	creative	content	plan
must	plan	throughout	the	year	in	order	to	get	an	overview	of	what	content	is	available
if	you	don	have	calendar	for	the	whole	year	you	don	know	what	to	post	each	day
which	is	waste	of	no	benefit	to	the	hotel
in	addition	you	can	choose	to	plan	your	content	in	the	form	of	regular	columns	which	will	make	it	easier	because	each	column	will	have	unique	content
causing	content	creators	not	to	get	lost
another	thing	that	creates	good	engagement	is	real	time	content	that	can	connect	to	the	hotel	business	but	not	everything	must	always	see	if	that	topic	fits	the	core	value	or	not
finally	when	creating	content	everything	is	laid	out	well
must	not	forget	about	closing	sales
if	not	being	able	to	close	the	sale	it	is	waste	of	time
including	having	to	communicate	with	offline	staff	to	know	online	because	if	customer	calls	in	the	employee	doesn	know	then	there	is	no	benefit	as	well
therefore	all	sides	must	know	all	the	information	and	can	close	the	sale	too
therefore	it	is	considered	that	online	marketing	is	successful
in	addition	to	the	theory	packed	for	hotel	operators	the	dots	hotel	game	changer	has	brought	the	actual	case	study	to	the	hotel	business	for	participants	to	bring	theory	to	practice
in	this	time	the	successful	business	model	of	heritage	boutique	hotel	to	study

inside	the	house	there	is	collection	of	the	history	of	luangrajamaitri	the	contributor	to	the	people	of	chanthaburi

create	the	participation	of	people	in	the	community	the	participation	of	people	in	the	community	is	considered	the	key	success	of	the	historic	inn
khun	phanumas	said	that	arsom	silp	institute	of	the	arts	architects	for	community	and	environment	has	created	participation	of	people	in	the	community	by	founded	co	ltd	to	make	chanthaboon	model	sample	project	of	conservation	with	the	concept	of	social	enterprise

which	this	model	proves	that	one	house	will	not	survive
but	the	chanthaboon	river	neighborhood	must	survive	and	that	will	make	business	to	survive	resurrect	the	building	to	life	narrating	historical	thoughts	through	the	room	khun	phapaporn	architectural	conservation	studio	director	from	the	arsom	silp	institute	of	the	arts	talking	about	design	inspiration	that	start	by	wanting	to	conserve	by	adding	creative	by	thinking	of	how	to	make	the	hotel	alive	and	can	talk	to	people
