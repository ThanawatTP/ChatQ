scb	techx	offers	types	of	ekyc
scb	techx	offers	an	sdk	package	that	provides	customers	access	to	range	of	ekyc	service	apis	such	as	liveness	ocr
additionally	it	provides	supplementary	dopa	services	and	an	sdk	package	for	ndid
by	integrating	sdk	into	their	solutions	customers	can	tailor	it	to	suit	their	customer	journeys	and	cater	to	their	own	clientele
this	includes	customization	options	such	as	themes	backgrounds	logos	button	colors	and	more

customers	can	simply	transmit	the	information	through	the	backend	system	ensuring	the	accuracy	of	the	dataset
this	approach	is	suitable	for	customers	who	do	not	require	an	sdk	and	have	already	developed	their	own	front	end	system
these	customers	can	leverage	ndid	service	by	connecting	through	scb	techxs	proxy

scb	techx	fintech	company	formed	as	joint	venture	between	scbx	group	and	digital	transformation	company	publicis	sapient	recently	collaborated	with	saas	cloud	banking	platform	mambu	consulting	and	digital	transformation	service	experts	publicis	sapient	and	the	worlds	most	comprehensive	and	broadly	adopted	cloud	offering	amazon	web	services	aws	to	organise	revolutionising	digital	lending	for	thailands	sustainable	future	economy	seminar
the	seminar	was	designed	to	educate	and	create	an	understanding	of	digital	lending	among	corporate	executives	and	companies	interested	in	operating	nano	finance	for	microfinance	and	regulated	small	loans	offered	to	individuals	by	provincial	financial	institutions	or	pico	finance
the	seminar	raised	awareness	of	the	changing	global	trends	in	digital	and	sustainability	issues	affecting	the	financial	sector	with	particular	focus	on	digital	lending	which	will	provide	opportunities	for	the	development	of	financial	services
the	seminar	covered	the	growing	trend	of	digital	credit	demand	which	is	likely	to	continue	to	increase	business	opportunities	in	the	face	of	stiff	competition	and	preparing	for	more	open	competition	in	thailand
mr	trirat	suwanprateeb	chief	executive	officer	of	scb	tech	co	ltd	stated	in	reference	to	the	seminar	scb	techxs	role	is	to	create	new	capabilities	from	digital	technology	platforms	and	modern	innovations	to	help	partners	and	organisations	expand	and	create	new	business
because	the	microfinance	business	for	underserved	low	income	earners	and	small	businesses	such	as	deposits	loans	and	fund	transfers	has	continued	to	grow	it	is	one	of	the	business	segments	on	which	we	focus
we	are	keen	on	digital	lending	for	this	group	of	customers	as	they	are	growing	continuously
depending	on	the	approved	credit	limit	and	purpose	microfinance	in	thailand	can	be	divided	into	three	main	services	nano	finance	microfinance	with	maximum	limit	of	baht	pico	finance	regulated	small	loans	offered	to	individuals	by	provincial	financial	institutions	with	maximum	limit	of	baht	and	digital	personal	loans	using	alternative	information	for	credit	approval	with	maximum	limit	of	baht
according	to	bloomberg	the	overall	microfinance	market	in	thailand	is	worth	approximately	billion	baht	while	at	the	same	time	more	than	percent	of	thai	people	have	no	access	to	formal	financial	resources	and	therefore	rely	on	informal	loans	making	the	informal	loan	market	worth	more	than	trillion	baht
once	the	covid	pandemic	subsides	these	numbers	suggest	that	the	nano	loan	and	pico	finance	markets	will	continue	growing
therefore	scb	techx	sees	opportunities	and	growth	potential	in	thailands	digital	lending	market
we	are	prepared	to	provide	advice	develop	systems	and	platforms	and	connect	business	alliances	that	will	help	nano	and	pico	finance	service	providers	meet	the	needs	of	their	clients	with	the	goal	of	expanding	thais	access	to	legitimate	financial	services
we	are	prepared	to	contribute	to	the	sustainability	of	the	economic	and	financial	system	and	the	continued	growth	of	the	nation	added	mr	trirat
mr	myles	bertrand	managing	director	mambu	apac	said	with	evolving	regulations	increasing	demand	and	growing	competition	agility	is	now	the	key	to	competitiveness	in	apacs	lending	industry
thailand	leads	the	region	in	terms	of	sme	lending	with	more	than	half	of	all	outstanding	business	loans	being	to	smes	with	financial	institutions	needing	to	be	lean	and	fast	particularly	around	loan	decisions	and	the	customer	experience	all	while	minimising	their	exposure	to	credit	and	compliance	risks

scb	techx	fintech	company	formed	as	joint	venture	between	scbx	group	and	digital	transformation	company	publicis	sapient	recently	collaborated	with	saas	cloud	banking	platform	mambu	consulting	and	digital	transformation	service	experts	publicis	sapient	and	the	worlds	most	comprehensive	and	broadly	adopted	cloud	offering	amazon	web	services	aws	to	organise	revolutionising	digital	lending	for	thailands	sustainable	future	economy	seminar
the	seminar	was	designed	to	educate	and	create	an	understanding	of	digital	lending	among	corporate	executives	and	companies	interested	in	operating	nano	finance	for	microfinance	and	regulated	small	loans	offered	to	individuals	by	provincial	financial	institutions	or	pico	finance
the	seminar	raised	awareness	of	the	changing	global	trends	in	digital	and	sustainability	issues	affecting	the	financial	sector	with	particular	focus	on	digital	lending	which	will	provide	opportunities	for	the	development	of	financial	services
the	seminar	covered	the	growing	trend	of	digital	credit	demand	which	is	likely	to	continue	to	increase	business	opportunities	in	the	face	of	stiff	competition	and	preparing	for	more	open	competition	in	thailand
mr	trirat	suwanprateeb	chief	executive	officer	of	scb	tech	co	ltd	stated	in	reference	to	the	seminar	scb	techxs	role	is	to	create	new	capabilities	from	digital	technology	platforms	and	modern	innovations	to	help	partners	and	organisations	expand	and	create	new	business
because	the	microfinance	business	for	underserved	low	income	earners	and	small	businesses	such	as	deposits	loans	and	fund	transfers	has	continued	to	grow	it	is	one	of	the	business	segments	on	which	we	focus
we	are	keen	on	digital	lending	for	this	group	of	customers	as	they	are	growing	continuously
depending	on	the	approved	credit	limit	and	purpose	microfinance	in	thailand	can	be	divided	into	three	main	services	nano	finance	microfinance	with	maximum	limit	of	baht	pico	finance	regulated	small	loans	offered	to	individuals	by	provincial	financial	institutions	with	maximum	limit	of	baht	and	digital	personal	loans	using	alternative	information	for	credit	approval	with	maximum	limit	of	baht
according	to	bloomberg	the	overall	microfinance	market	in	thailand	is	worth	approximately	billion	baht	while	at	the	same	time	more	than	percent	of	thai	people	have	no	access	to	formal	financial	resources	and	therefore	rely	on	informal	loans	making	the	informal	loan	market	worth	more	than	trillion	baht
once	the	covid	pandemic	subsides	these	numbers	suggest	that	the	nano	loan	and	pico	finance	markets	will	continue	growing
therefore	scb	techx	sees	opportunities	and	growth	potential	in	thailands	digital	lending	market
we	are	prepared	to	provide	advice	develop	systems	and	platforms	and	connect	business	alliances	that	will	help	nano	and	pico	finance	service	providers	meet	the	needs	of	their	clients	with	the	goal	of	expanding	thais	access	to	legitimate	financial	services
we	are	prepared	to	contribute	to	the	sustainability	of	the	economic	and	financial	system	and	the	continued	growth	of	the	nation	added	mr	trirat
mr	myles	bertrand	managing	director	mambu	apac	said	with	evolving	regulations	increasing	demand	and	growing	competition	agility	is	now	the	key	to	competitiveness	in	apacs	lending	industry
thailand	leads	the	region	in	terms	of	sme	lending	with	more	than	half	of	all	outstanding	business	loans	being	to	smes	with	financial	institutions	needing	to	be	lean	and	fast	particularly	around	loan	decisions	and	the	customer	experience	all	while	minimising	their	exposure	to	credit	and	compliance	risks
composability	is	the	answer	to	thriving	in	this	age	of	change	with	cloud	native	platform	like	mambu	lenders	have	the	scalability	and	agility	to	introduce	new	features	safely	while	keeping	pace	with	their	customer	expectations	with	over	third	of	the	adult	population	in	southeast	asia	still	unbanked	or	underbanked	thailand	offers	one	of	the	largest	untapped	opportunities	for	the	financial	services	industry	in	the	world	today
